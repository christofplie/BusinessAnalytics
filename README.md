# **Sentiment Analysis and Clustering on AutoML Support Forum Data**  

This repository contains code developed for a project aimed at analyzing user discussions in the AutoML support forum of RapidMiner. The primary focus was to answer two key research questions:  

1. **What are user issues that are discussed online in the AutoML support forum?**  
   - This question was explored using n-grams to identify recurring patterns and terms in user posts.  

2. **What are the characteristics of these discussions?**  
   - This was addressed by conducting sentiment analysis and comparing results between different sentiment evaluation approaches, including VADER and GPT-4o.  

Clustering was also performed to group questions into potential categories due to the lack of explicit topic information in the dataset.

## **Files and Execution Order**  

### **1. Preprocessing.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset by performing lemmatization, language detection, and stopword removal.  
- Produces a preprocessed version of the data for further analysis.  

**Usage:**  
Run this file first to generate the cleaned dataset.  

---

### **2. Analysis.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Answers the first research question by generating n-grams to detect common patterns in user issues.  
- Performs clustering based on TF-IDF representations.  

**Usage:**  
Requires the preprocessed dataset generated by `Preprocessing.py`.  

---

### **3. BertAnalysis.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Similar to `Analysis.py`, but uses BERT embeddings for clustering instead of TF-IDF.  
- Generates scatter plots and identifies the most significant words in each cluster.  

**Usage:**  
Provides an alternative clustering approach using modern embeddings.  

---

### **4. Sentiment.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Answers the second research question by using VADER to determine sentiment categories (Positive, Neutral, Negative) for each forum question.  
- This analysis is performed on the uncleaned version of the questions to retain the full context.  

---

### **5. AzureOpenAI.ipynb**  
**Purpose:**  
- Complements `Sentiment.py` by using GPT-4o through Azure OpenAI API for sentiment analysis.  
- Generates an additional sentiment category column for comparison with VADER results.  

**Usage:**  
Ensure API access is configured before running this notebook.  

---

### **6. Plotting.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Visualizes sentiment distributions and generates confusion matrices to compare sentiment classifications between:  
  - **Original (VADER)**  
  - **GPT Sentiment**  
  - **Custom thresholds (if available)**  

**Usage:**  
Requires outputs from `Sentiment.py` and `AzureOpenAI.ipynb`.  

---

### **7. Wordcloud.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Generates a word cloud from the most frequent lemmatized terms in the dataset.  

**Usage:**  
Provides a simple visualization of key terms.  

---

### **8. VaderTest.py**  
**Purpose:**  
- Allows testing of individual sentences with VADER by showing sentiment categories assigned to each token (Positive, Neutral, Negative).  

**Usage:**  
Helpful for understanding how VADER evaluates sentiment on a token level.

## **Instructions for Replication**  

1. **Run `Preprocessing.py`** to clean and preprocess the dataset.  
2. **Execute `Analysis.py` and `BertAnalysis.py`** to explore user issues through n-grams and clustering techniques.  
3. **Perform sentiment analysis with `Sentiment.py` and `AzureOpenAI.ipynb`.**  
4. **Use `Plotting.py`** to visualize sentiment distributions and compare classification results.  
5. Optionally, **run `Wordcloud.py`** for a word cloud visualization and **`VaderTest.py`** to inspect VADER's sentiment classification.
