Thus, I am seeking the RapidMiner community's advice regarding my process.Actually, I am trying to develop an early prediction model for predicting the value of column D using A, B, and C features. As my data is sequential, I tried two different preprocessing procedures to preprocess the dataset and train the deep learning model for early prediction.In the first process, I used sequence and batch procedures. I tried to loop through the sequences and create 30% of the sequences for each batch. Then I replaced the final score (the final value) of each batch in the D column at the end of the 30% (for example, if I had 60 sequences in one batch, I sliced out the first 20 sequences and placed the final value of column D (in row 60) at row 20 in column D). After the data preprocessing, I used cross-validation to train the deep learning model.On the other hand, in the second process, I used the window operator. I looped through the values of the dataset and created a 30% time step window for each batch. Then I placed the final value of each batch as a label for the 30% window. Then I used cross-validation to train the deep learning model.I attached both processes, as well as a sample of my dataset. Therefore, I seek your advice regarding my concerns, which are:Is there any overall advice regarding these two processes?Is it allowed to use the windowing approach for preprocessing sequential data, even though it is often used for date and time series data?During model training using both processes, I faced an issue with the cross-validation performance results. I got a low squared correlation value; however, the relative error and the RMSE values were good. Is there any justification for this issue?My issue with the two processes is that I usually get a low squared correlation value when I train the RNN model or LSTM. Is there any advice that could help me enhance the performance results in terms of RMSE, RE, and squared correlation?Is there any advice that can help me handle the issue of getting good performance results using unseen data but bad results in the cross-validation performance results?",FALSE

On the other hand, if it is paired with military, economic, or political it has a far different meaning. strategy, military strategy, economic strategy, and political strategy are all different ideas. Statistical based text processing will not extract the context of these words, but it will tell you how many times strategy, military, economic, and political shows up in your documents or data. This gives you information but lacks context. So the question is """"How do you extract this context via statistical based text processing in RapidMiner?"""". The answer: Generate n-Grams (terms). The operator’s algorithm is quite simple. Generate n-Grams (terms) will check for words that frequently follow one another. Following the example above, RapidMiner will pick out strategy and military as new attributes, each of which are words. Next it will say, often strategy is followed by military. Thus, it makes a new attribute military_strategy This selection can also be improved via pruning. There will be a footnote on pruning later. The result is now that there are 3 attributes: strategy, military, and military_strategy. Without having the machine understand the context, it was still able to identify grouped words in which the data scientist can now understand the context in which military strategy is related. The key here is that it bypasses the machines’ need to understand the language and pushes it onto the user while still maintaining groups of associated words within our data set.   Getting started: You will need the Text Processing extension in order to use both the process documents operator and the generate n-grams operator. There are a few other operators you will need from this extension as well. A guide to installing extensions including the text processing extension can be found here.  Text document. You can either create one or call a text file. This guide will encompass the first. Step 1: Generating the Document All that is needed here is to place a create document operator. Then proceed to parameters window and open the 'Edit Text' button. This should pull up a window that will allow you to type or insert text to be pushed through the process documents operator for text processing. Any amount of text can be added but these 2 sentences should do the trick: """"The distinction between our strategy and theirs is that ours is a true military strategy. Theirs is a poor excuse of military strategy that can be summed up by hit and run tactics with a side of cowardice."""" This sample text will utilize the example we talked about above. This will allow RapidMiner to find the connection between military and strategy.      Step 2: Process Documents The next step is to add in the text processing operator. Once its in place, there is a sub-process icon in the bottom right which denotes that there is another level to the operator. Double clicking will bring you into that level. Once there, a tokenize operator is needed. Then the """"Any non-letters"""" option in the parameters tab needs to be selected. These two operators in conjunction will say, 'generate a word whenever two non-letters are separated by letter characters. For example ' Space.', the empty space and the period are the two non-letters that generate the word space. Next, a transform cases operator set to lowercase is also needed. This will ensure that """"The"""" and """"the"""" are pulled out as the same word.                           Step 3: Generate n-Grams The last operator needed is generate n-grams (terms). Here, a max length of two is a sufficient setting for the length parameter. There is not a large amount of text to use so there is no need for a length larger than two. The last task required is to connect the wordlist and the example set out puts to the result nodes on the right. Once this is hooked up, the process can be ran by either pressing the run button or F11.    Notice that strategy, military, and military_strategy were all pulled out as unique words. This is the desired result. There are also term frequencies associated with each attribute.   Footnote: Pruning On the process documents operator, there is a parameter for pruning. If this is set to absolute pruning and that is set to two, then RapidMiner will only keep words in the document that show up two times or more. It will cut down the final result and only show frequent engrams. For this case, a low prune generates the desired result but pruning can be an extremely tedious task once there are thousands of words being processed.",FALSE

First off, this may or may not relate to RapidMiner's problem directly. It's just that i am stuck with my data, to go through with using Map operator (as part of ETL process). Please note that I am first and foremost a language student and I had to take this course as a requirement. So, i basically have zero knowledge on this.This is the data I'm using and as you can see, they are mostly numerical and just numbers. While the sample i learn how to use Map operator from, uses Map for changing types of Gender(attribute), or at least something other than numbers. The question is, can someone show me how we use Map operator for something very vast and has different values every time (e.g. passengers count, seats count, distance of flight like in the data)? I'm thinking, it may be possible if i choose only some of the data and use the Map operator for attributes like 'Destination_city'(which has more consistent data meaning there are 100 flights that leave from Nevada for example). But this is probably a whole another thing? I am confused. If theres anyone that can help me, I would greatly appreciate it.p/s: i cannot post link to the data bc im still a newbie",FALSE

You just have to work around it by:<citing gemini now>""""Convert Labels:Use the """"Nominal to Binominal"""" operator. This simplifies your problem to a binary classification by combining multiple label classes into two. However, this approach loses information about the original class distribution.One-vs-Rest Approach:Build separate models for each unique class in the polynomial label. Each model predicts that class as positive and all others as negative.Use """"Compare ROCs"""" on these individual models.

So for example if """"Salary"""" """"pay"""" """"paid"""" occurs more often in negative reviews it could mean that a company has to update their salary structure to improve Employee Satisfaction.I thought of using Naive Bayes to do that. What I basically did is, I labelled the reviews as either positive or negative, then I applied the process I attached to this comment. The Output of this process features a list of words and there likelyhoods to occur in either positive or negative texts (from my understanding of what NB does). For example I attached the likelyhoods of the word """"Berufseinstieg"""" (which translates to """"starting to work""""). In the next step I would group similar words like (sticking to the example) """"Salary"""" """"pay"""" """"Money"""" and interpret the likelyhoods to find factors that Employees tend to find great or bad. Could I use the output of NB in the way I described or would that be wrong because I am quite new to sentiment analysis and I could not find any papers with studies that did something like this.Thanks a lot in Advance and have a great day",FALSE

It seems RM only render the last few lines that carries this type of data. I also tested this with breakpoints, I connected several operators outputting this same type of object, and have a breakpoint for each of them, when I executed the operators one by one, the first four operators have normal output line color. However, when I executed the fifth operator, the color for the first one returned to gray which was the default. Sometimes, this breakpoint method have kept all the color and sometimes not, if I don't set the breakpoint and execute the process as a whole, there will only be the last 4 lines colored. Also, even in the case where all the colors were kept because of the breakpoint, when I go to the higher process and return to this subprocess, the color will again only available to the last 4 lines.

In the Optimize Selection operator, the two greedy algorithms (forward selection and backward elimination) are clearly specified. However, in the case of the Linear Regression operator, it is not yet clear which algorithm/approach is used in case of the built-in """"greedy"""" feature selection dropdown option for the Linear Regression operator. I could not find any elaboration on this in the documentation for Linear Regression operator. Also, I checked the source code for this option. According to it -This class implements an internal forward selection for the linear regression. It uses the Akaike Criterion that is maximized roundwise. Each round the attribute minimizing the akaike criterion is deselected.I am trying to understand the exact model selection process happening here and the description and the code is a bit unclear to me. 1. The above statement says internal forward selection. But the later sentence """"..attribute minimizing the akaike criterion is deselected."""" suggests backward elimination. Which one is it? Can someone elaborate on this?2. How is AIC criterion computed here? A couple of sources (link1 and link2) suggest AIC for linear regression as n x ln(SSE / n) + 2 (k + 1) where n is the number of observations and k is the number of predictors (one is added for the intercept term). The source code states - akaike = (numberOfExamples - numberOfUsedAttributes) + 2 * numberOfUsedAttributes;This is a bit confusing as well. Any insights would be appreciated.",FALSE

A description of the variables can be found below.I have imported the (training) dataset into Rapid Miner and assigned the proper role and type to each of them. However, I am running into the following and cannot find an answer on the internet or within this community.The binomial variables beginning with 'flg_missing' indicate for each row whether the value is missing in the dataset. So for example, if the 'flg_missing_year' for row X has the value 1, then the value in the column 'year' is missing. For some columns this can also be determined from the column itself (for example, for the column 'year', the dataset returns 0 which of course means a missing value). However, for other columns the value 0 can also be interpreted as a logical value (e.g. 'n_weeks_old', which indicates how long a house has been for sale). Because this means that there is not a logical missing value placed in the dataset for each column, I am not getting anywhere with the 'missing value' operators. Because of this, it seems to me that the only logical way for Rapidminer to correctly interpret the missing values is by using these binary 'flg_missing' columns. I just have no idea how. Is there anyone who can help me on my way with this? At first I was thinking of creating extra columns where based on conditional conditions the value is included in the column (if it is not a missing value) and otherwise not. The solution does not seem to be simply removing the rows with missing values. When I do this I am left with ±50 rows from the dataset that now has almost 5000. To be clear, it is absolutely not my intention to have the model built entirely by others without making any effort myself. I have already done a lot of research myself, but simply can't figure it out.Thanks in advance for the responses!",FALSE

I am building a super operator, I noticed the extension called """"Custom Operator"""" where you can turn a process into an operator, I want to know whether it is possible to define the inner structure of a super operator when coding in JAVA in a similar way, or is the super operator can only be blank when following the Rapidminer's definition in JAVA without using custom operators extension?3. A minor problem is I am using lots of """"Multiply Operator"""" in my process and they take up much space, I cannot simply connect two input ports from one output port.

Sorry for bothering with my Newbie-Question!My problem:I have missing values for a certain date attribute -Date1- that I want to fill up. It's actually quite easy, because I have two other attributes that will help me calculate the missing values. So there's a numeric attribute like -DaysUntil- and the other Date -Date2-. I have Date2 and -DaysUntil-, so Date2 - DaysUntil  would give me my Date1 that I need. As I said, -DaysUntil- is numeric, like 10 for example, and Date2 a date value. I can't calculate with those formats, so I already used the Date to Numeric Operator to get a numeric value for my Date2. I used day in the epoch. So now what I can do is to just substract the numeric values like given above, but that leaves me with a numeric value (day in epoch) for my Date1. (I need Date1 as a Date format though)The Numeric to Date Operator doesn't work for this kind of 'back conversion'.So how do I get my Date1 as a Date format value now? Or should I use a different Operator for calculation in the first place? Thank you so much for your answers!",FALSE

They agree for the remaining seed choices.Runs  1 & 2 results agree for k = 3 & 5.Because the problem appeared to manifest with k -1, I tried a few runs but started with k = 3, instead of 1.Batch 2:-Run 1. k = 3, 5, ...., 25Run 2. k = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.Run 3. k = 3.Again, mutual inconsistencies showed up only with k = 3. Notably, the same results showed up for k = 3 and Local Seed = 1 in Run 1 and k = 3 and Local Seed = 11 in Run 2. There may be other such peculiarities but this caught my eye.The Seed = 1 and Seed = 11 results for the two runs are not the same but the Grid results for Seed 1 and Seed 11 """"criss-cross"""" as just mentioned between the two runs.And, the results for k = 3 from the second batch of three runs do not match the results for k = 3 from the first batch.As stated at the outset, all else is exactly the same in these runs, to my knowledge. Am I missing something obvious? I am using the same platform to run these.

kN values using four variable values from A to D.What I ultimately want is to find the values of variables A~D that minimize the kg value and maximize the kN value based on the learned model.First, I loaded the data and then designated the label values as meta data.After multiplying the data, one part created a model.Actually, don't understand the remaining part, but I made it by following the tutorial. (filter example)I connected the model and the above filter data to Prescriptive Optimization,After assigning attributes A to D, I set the bounds of the variables.Inside the operator, apply model and performance are connected.Lastly, I used the generate attributes operator by specifying kN - kg = amount and maximizing the amount value.However, when I run it, I see that only certain values are repeated.Could you please confirm which part is wrong?I think the simulator's optimization function and this Prescriptive Optimization operator will be very helpful to me.thank you",FALSE
"MartinLiebig","October 23, 2023 5:56AM","Is optimization possible in a multi-label problem?","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/60467/is-optimization-possible-in-a-multi-label-problem","For example, there is data with 7 variables, 2 of which are designated as prediction targets (labels), and for convenience, we will call them A and B (real type labels).A and B predictions could be performed without problems using multi-label modeling operators.In addition to this, what I want to do is a multi-label version of ‘Optimize’.‘Optimize’ in Model Simulator is my favorite featureWhen there was only one label, I could easily check the value of each independent variable that maximized or minimized the label value using the optimize function.Is this feature also available in multi-label models?First, I confirmed that the multi-label model is not connected to the model simulator.Even if I don't use a model simulator,When there are two or more labels, I want to derive the values of each independent variable that maximize or minimize the values while satisfying the conditions of the given labels.For example1.

I want to classify a set of online comments (examples) into two classes (call them online behaviour A and online behaviour b. My plan is to put the classified comments into a growth curve model to see how the frequency of behaviour A and behaviour b change over time. It occurs to me that if behaviour A diminishes and behaviour b increases over time (as hypothesized), then there will be many instances of comments that exhibit aspects of both behaviours. My thinking is that if I calculate probability of class membership (in A and/or b) for each example comment, I will capture the instances of examples that fall into both classes and I can then use a cutoff to use to select comments for the growth curve model). My question is this: when developing the training set, do I classify comments that I consider either A or b only (and let Rapidminer assign class membership percentage for all comments on this basis) OR should I also classify training example comments I consider as belonging to both A and b as I develop the training set? I am assuming a binomial classification (A or b) but wonder if I need multi-label classification with a third class representing a blend of A and b with blended comments identified in the training set. Appreciate any insight you can provide.",FALSE

I ran the following command to execute a simple workflow that I scp to the server: username@serverip:~/rapidminer/rapidminer-studio/scripts$ ./rapidminer-batch.sh -f '/home/username/rapidminer/process/test.rmp'. The execution failed and it took a quite long time for the execution. (I have attached the workflow and the log file to this post) Here are some questions I got:   How do I create a      workflow in Rapidminer without GUI? My local machine is using Windows and      has Rapidminer installed. Currently, I just exported some workflow on my      local machine and scp them to the server. Are these workflows compatible      with different distributions of Rapidminers?  How to install extensions on      RapidMiner without GUI?

All my background is in Python language. I will explain my problem but unfortunately, I can't provide any images right now. I follow some tutorials for creating a word2vec model and saving it ( or another option we can download a pre-train model). However, I have huge cuorps around 100,000 records. So, I am sure there are a huge number of words will be. but the model shows me only around 2000 words even when I try to make the window size and frequency of the word low. This is the first problem. Now coming to the second problem. I used the word2vec that I built with 2000 words. After that, i saw some tutorials on how to use embedding layers and text to embedding ID. They used a format with 4 columns ( ID, batch, word, label). they tokenized the sentence and put each token in a new row. I did my best to have the same format. But, even when I did it. I end up with two problems. This format will take up huge space when the data is too large and when I use word2vec with text to embedding id will replace the words with -2 for all of them I don't know why and what -2 means here? if anyone did text classification with deep learning and word2vec I would appreciate his support. I really need a solution for these problems or at least an example of how to do it in RapidMiner. I have the 9.10.4 RapidMiner version.Thanks in advance!.",FALSE

Click here to read the release notes and other documentation for RapidMiner Studio — and here for documentation on RapidMiner AI Hub.   Please contact our support team here if you have any questions about the upgrade or need any technical assistance.     Learn more about the Altair RapidMiner platform here.     This short video provides an overview of the changes in this new release:              https://rapidminer.wistia.com/medias/huw3o6j0ip&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      Here are highlights of this release:  Interactive decision trees: Decision trees are highly explainable and allow people, even those without data science backgrounds, to visualize complex interactions within data and understand exactly how an AI model produces its output. Altair RapidMiner Studio now provides business users, data scientists, and analysts with a wizard-based tool for building Altair’s unique, patented decision trees that they can incorporate into their AI models. Users can grow trees automatically, find the best splits, delete splits, and save scoring workflows they can then deploy using Altair RapidMiner AI Hub. Decision trees built in Altair RapidMiner Studio are based on the same technology implemented in Altair Knowledge Studio. Note: Activating the interactive decision tree feature results in a draw of 10 additional Altair Units.Spark 3 support in Radoop: The Radoop extension for Altair RapidMiner Studio provides a graphical interface for analyzing data on Hadoop clusters. This release supports Spark 3, making it fully compatible with Java 11 and Altair RapidMiner 10.x, and including all existing capabilities related to push-down execution in Spark.Scalable and user-friendly web APIs: Using Altair RapidMiner AI Hub, users can now expose workflows built in Altair RapidMiner Studio as scalable and secure web API (that is, REST) endpoints easily through the web interface of AI Hub. They can deploy endpoints to load-balanced groups of web API agents and trigger updates of deployments manually or automatically. This greatly simplifies the deployment process and improves scalability and security for AI models built in Altair RapidMiner Studio and deployed on RapidMiner AI Hub.Other important changes: This release ships a language pack for Japanese and Chinese (note that we do not yet have translated version of the documentation). RapidMiner AI Hub now allows users to clean up project histories manually or automatically. Users can also create Panopticon dashboards that display the output of RapidMiner workflows.   Training  RapidMiner Academy offers bite-sized learning along with curated courses and pathways, designed to match roles, knowledge domains, and skill levels. Everything in RapidMiner Academy is self-paced, and free — including our certification program. Check out the Get Started with RapidMiner and Machine Learning path for an introduction to RapidMiner Studio, as well as important data science concepts.    We also host live, interactive training sessions about the Altair RapidMiner platform every month.

"Manhhungk12","August 13, 2023 11:23AM","Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP)","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/24520/generalized-sequential-pattern-gsp","Dear Sir/MadameMy name is Tasos Ioannou and I am a Phd student from TU Delft, the Netherlands. I am new to rapid miner and I am trying to play with GSP in order to find patterns of occupancy (daily presence or not) in residential houses. My data are like this: Timestamp      Type of Room--    House 1 --  House 2 -- House 3 -- etc.3/6/2015 00:00      Kitchen                 0                   1                13/6/2015 00:05      Kitchen                 1                   0                13/6/2015 00:10      Kitchen                 0                   1                13/6/2015 00:20      Kitchen                 0                   0                0 So first column is the time stamp (every five minutes for a period of several months), second column is the type of room and the rest of the columns are the readings of the presence sensors in 0,1 format (1 when a person's presence was detected within the five minutes interval and 0 when no presence was detected). I am trying to use the GSP to find patterns of occupancy for a whole day between all the houses (32 dwellings in total). Following the description of the process operator and looking at the tutorial example I have made a file but seems that  I am missing something since instead of results I am getting a view of the example set (!) which I have already seen before using the ''break point after'' option.  The customer id is the type of rooms (Kitchen, Living Room etc), the houses (House 1, House 2 etc) are the attributes.My questions are as follows: 1) For the time attribute I am transforming the date to numerical as necessary, that would result in a time column from 1-288. Does that make sense? In the tutorial example the time is a column with only one value (1). 2) Do you think there is maybe another problem? Maybe the GSP is not the correct tool for what I am trying to achieve? I would really use some suggestions on this, on how to improve my set up, or use another process operator?Note that I have made all the necessary transformations to the data (the 0,1 have been transformed into true or false)The results I was hoping could be described like this: in specific 5 minute intervals of the day, lets say 6/3/2015 15:55 there is presence detected in (House1,House 2,House3, House4 etc). Like that I was hoping to identify the times of the day where most of the houses have occupancy detected or not.The code for the  whole process:<?xml version=""""1.0"""" encoding=""""UTF-8"""" standalone=""""no""""?><process version=""""6.5.002"""">  <context>    <input/>    <output/>    <macros/>  </context>  <operator activated=""""true"""" class=""""process"""" compatibility=""""6.5.002"""" expanded=""""true"""" name=""""Process"""">    <process expanded=""""true"""">      <operator activated=""""true"""" class=""""read_excel"""" compatibility=""""6.5.002"""" expanded=""""true"""" height=""""60"""" name=""""Read Excel"""" width=""""90"""" x=""""112"""" y=""""75"""">        <parameter key=""""excel_file"""" value=""""D:\Ecommon Data\Data Analysis\Houses without Balanced Ventilation\Yes-No\Presence.xlsx""""/>        <parameter key=""""sheet_number"""" value=""""5""""/>        <parameter key=""""imported_cell_range"""" value=""""A1:L289""""/>        <parameter key=""""first_row_as_names"""" value=""""false""""/>        <list key=""""annotations"""">          <parameter key=""""0"""" value=""""Name""""/>        </list>        <list key=""""data_set_meta_data_information"""">          <parameter key=""""0"""" value=""""Customer id.true.polynominal.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""1"""" value=""""W001.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""2"""" value=""""W002.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""3"""" value=""""W010.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""4"""" value=""""W011.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""5"""" value=""""W021.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""6"""" value=""""W022.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""7"""" value=""""W024.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""8"""" value=""""W028.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""9"""" value=""""W032.true.integer.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""10"""" value=""""Time.true.date_time.attribute""""/>          <parameter key=""""11"""" value=""""L.false.attribute_value.attribute""""/>        </list>      </operator>      <operator activated=""""true"""" breakpoints=""""after"""" class=""""date_to_numerical"""" compatibility=""""6.5.002"""" expanded=""""true"""" height=""""76"""" name=""""Date to Numerical"""" width=""""90"""" x=""""246"""" y=""""75"""">        <parameter key=""""attribute_name"""" value=""""Time""""/>        <parameter key=""""time_unit"""" value=""""minute""""/>        <parameter key=""""minute_relative_to"""" value=""""day""""/>      </operator>      <operator activated=""""true"""" breakpoints=""""after"""" class=""""numerical_to_binominal"""" compatibility=""""6.5.002"""" expanded=""""true"""" height=""""76"""" name=""""Numerical to Binominal"""" width=""""90"""" x=""""380"""" y=""""75"""">        <parameter key=""""attribute_filter_type"""" value=""""subset""""/>        <parameter key=""""attributes"""" value=""""W001|W002|W010|W011|W021|W022|W024|W028|W032""""/>      </operator>      <operator activated=""""true"""" class=""""generalized_sequential_patterns"""" compatibility=""""6.5.002"""" expanded=""""true"""" height=""""76"""" name=""""GSP"""" width=""""90"""" x=""""581"""" y=""""75"""">        <parameter key=""""customer_id"""" value=""""Customer id""""/>        <parameter key=""""time_attribute"""" value=""""Time""""/>        <parameter key=""""window_size"""" value=""""1.0""""/>        <parameter key=""""max_gap"""" value=""""1.0""""/>        <parameter key=""""min_gap"""" value=""""1.0""""/>        <parameter key=""""positive_value"""" value=""""true""""/>      </operator>      <connect from_op=""""Read Excel"""" from_port=""""output"""" to_op=""""Date to Numerical"""" to_port=""""example set input""""/>      <connect from_op=""""Date to Numerical"""" from_port=""""example set output"""" to_op=""""Numerical to Binominal"""" to_port=""""example set input""""/>      <connect from_op=""""Numerical to Binominal"""" from_port=""""example set output"""" to_op=""""GSP"""" to_port=""""example set""""/>      <connect from_op=""""GSP"""" from_port=""""example set"""" to_port=""""result 1""""/>      <portSpacing port=""""source_input 1"""" spacing=""""0""""/>      <portSpacing port=""""sink_result 1"""" spacing=""""0""""/>      <portSpacing port=""""sink_result 2"""" spacing=""""0""""/>    </process>  </operator></process>I am looking forward to hearing from you, thank you in advance for your time and effort on this.

It is really no great mystery - they are nothing more than RapidMiner wrappers for the standard free version of the Twitter REST API:   Search Twitter operator -> https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview Get User Statuses, Details, Relations -> https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/overview   There is a lot more functionality in the Twitter REST API suite; the four queries that RapidMiner provides are simply the ones we felt would be most useful to the most users.   As for rate limiting, the four RapidMiner Twitter operators have daily query limits that are managed by Twitter, not RapidMiner. I will summarize the ones that control the four operators here, with the caveat that these are completely subject to change by Twitter and are only effective as of this date (July 2018):   Search Twitter 450 queries per 15 minute window (one row of data = one query) Get Twitter User Status 900 queries per 15 minute window (one row of data = one query) Get Twitter User Details 900 queries per 15 minute window (one row of data = one query) Get Twitter Relations 15 queries per 15 minunte window (one row of data = one query)    If you want more queries than are allotted here, you should go to their """"Premium Services"""" API which is beyond the scope of this brief KB.    Hope this helps!   Scott",FALSE

"BalazsBarany","June 26, 2023 3:44AM","Tutorial for the GeoProcessing extension","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/56877/tutorial-for-the-geoprocessing-extension","There is new an extension called GeoProcessing in the RapidMiner Marketplace. To give you an idea of what you can do with this extension, here is a tutorial using some of the operators.Our fictional scenario: We're working with the city of Vienna, Austria, to celebrate the long history of Vienna and the river Danube. For the celebrations, we would like to organize a boat race and a running event for children. We are working with geodata from the Open Data server of Vienna.In the 1970s Vienna built an artificial island inside the Danube, called Donauinsel (Danube Island). Since then there's the Danube (left arm on the picture) and the New Danube (right). Here's a map to give you an idea:We are only interested in the parts of the Danube and the New Danube that flow through Vienna. These are highlighted in the next map:The boat race should be in the longest part of the Danube (or New Danube) through Vienna, so we want to determine the length of the river parts.For the children's running event, we want to select the two bridges with the shortest distance between them. All bridges in Vienna are of course also available on the Open Data server:We are obviously only interested in the bridges over the Danube, not every bridge in Vienna. So we will filter the data accordingly:Then we will calculate the distance between every bridge and select the shortest one (ignoring very short distances of multi-part bridges).In order to make RapidMiner capable of doing all this, install the GeoProcessing extension from the Marketplace. Make sure that you see the Geoprocessing folder in your Extensions in the Operators panel.Some background knowledgeEarth is an irregular ellipsoid, but we like to look at maps in two dimensions, as these are more suitable for computer screens or paper. This transformation to two dimensions also allows the application of geometry calculations like distance, length, area and so on. We express global coordinates in latitude and longitude degrees (counted from the equator and from the international 0 meridian in Greenwich). These are angles, so the distance between coordinates depends on the geographic position. We can't use these coordinates for calculating absolute sizes in our favourite measurement system (meters, yards, miles, ...). The process of transforming coordinates to a new coordinate system (CRS, coordinate reference system) is called projection or reprojection. You can think of it as taking a photo from an airplane or a satellite to transform the three-dimensional earth surface to a two-dimensional picture. The projected coordinates can be measured in meters or other units, and geometry functions will give us the expected measurements.Coordinate systems are referred to by EPSG codes. You can check epsg.io to find an appropriate coordinate system for the area you're working on.It's not always necessary to reproject coordinates. If we only want to know if a geometry contains or touches another geometry, we can calculate that in the original coordinate system (if we ignore problems spanning the line between longitudes -180° and 180°).  Getting the dataThe Vienna open data server contains geodata in many formats. We can easily use the CSV version in RapidMiner. The example process loads the data directly from the web, you could of course save them locally if you need them more often.This process contains standard RapidMiner operators only, the extension is not yet in use. The Read CSV operators are set up with the comma as the separator, and UTF-8 encoding, but otherwise with the default settings. The attribute names come from the first line, the data format is determined automatically.We only keep a few attributes (the geometry and the object name) and rename them for later use. For example, the river geometry is renamed to riverGeom.The standard for expressing geometries in textual form is called WKT, Well Known Text. The open data server delivers the geometries in this format, and this is also the format used by the GeoProcessing operators. If you have GIS data in a database, you can use ST_AsText in SQL to get them in this format.The tutorial processAfter reading the data, we first extract the parts of the Danube inside the boundaries of Vienna. We use Calculate Geometry Relation for this (Danube inside Vienna in the process). It has one input, so we need both the Vienna and the Danube coordinates in one example set. The easiest way to achieve this is a Cartesian join (it combines every row from the first example set with every row from the second one). We use the intersection function of Calculate Geometry Relation for getting the result. It returns the common part of the two geometries (a polygon and a line) as another geometry, in our case a shorter line (just the part of the Danube inside the Vienna polygon). We then filter out the New Danube for the bridges, but keep both parts for the river part length calculation.We want to get the length in meters here, not in ellipsoid degrees. So we reproject the original coordinates to a projection commonly used in Austria, ETRS89/Austria (EPSG code: 3416). This projection is appropriate here. If you work in a different geographical area, be sure to select an appropriate projection. (Choosing a wrong projection will lead to big distortions in the calculated measures.)After reprojecting to EPSG:3416, we can calculate the length of the river arms with Calculate measures on a geometry (called Calculate river length here). Now on to the bridges. First we want to find bridges that cross the Danube. This is a geographic join operation if we apply it on two example sets. We select the function crosses here. Other functions include contains/containedBy, intersects, overlaps, touches, etc. The function parameter stays empty here, it is only used by isWithinDistance.Now we can create a distance """"matrix"""" (not formatted as a matrix) for all the selected bridges. This happens in a subprocess. To calculate distances, we will of course reproject the bridge coordinates to the Austrian meter-based coordinate system. We join the bridge table with itself using a Cartesian join so we get a row for every combination of bridges, but remove the row if it compares the bridge with itself.Then we use Calculate Geometry Relation with the distance function on the projected geometries. We then filter out everything with a distance of less than 100 meters to avoid returning irrelevant combinations (some smaller parts of the bridges are separate entries in the data). Now we can sort the data by distance and return the first row. According to our data, """"Steg an der Nordbahnbrücke"""" and """"Floridsdorfer Brücke"""" would be the nearest ones, with a distance of 481 meters.That's it, we are done with the analysis. We imported geodata from the Web, transformed coordinates, combined different example sets with different methods and calculated real-world measures on the geometries.Some directions you could go from there:- Use the operator Geometry to Coordinates to visualize data (it works best with point geometries, or if you have a large number of geometries)- Try different ways to geographically join example sets- Try out the different functions in Calculate Geometry Relation and Calculate measures on a geometryI'm looking forward to your questions and remarks on the GeoProcessing extension and this tutorial.",FALSE

No. But it will redefine the data analyst role.  By Galen Okazaki in TDS     May 24, 2023     Since ChatGPT’s release in November of 2022, speculation has grown over whether or not the role of a data analyst could eventually be replaced by generative AI (ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat are among the large language models included in this classification). Much of this speculation is fueled by the ability of these large language models(LLMs) to write code.  As someone who has been in the data analysis field for the majority of my professional career, understanding the impact of generative AI in our field is something that has definitely piqued my interest. Giving in to curiosity, I have since spent a fair amount of time assessing the current capabilities of generative AI within the context of data analysis.  In this article, I summarize and share my findings with you as I believe generative AI will have a significant role in data analysis work going forward. Furthermore, I believe that it is imperative for the data analyst community to understand the profound impact it will have on not only their field but the business landscape as a whole.  Where We Stand Today  At this point, we know that generative AI can write SQL, Python, and R code. We can also assume the efficiency of the code they produce will only get better over time with continuous fine-tuning. But that’s just the start.  At the end of March (2023), OpenAI’s ChatGPT released a plugin called Code Interpreter. If you are one of the few who currently have access to the Alpha version, you can upload data files into it and invoke Python to perform regression analysis and descriptive analysis, look for patterns in your data and even create visualizations. All without having to write or even know a line of Python code! Esteemed Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick has a nice write-up on this.  So there you have it. The ability to load, analyze, and present data without writing a stitch of code. Game over yes? Not so fast.  As incredibly impressive as these capabilities are, there are some significant limitations to Code Intrepretor, that are indicative of some of the challenges that generative AI would have in taking over the data analysis industry.  First, it requires the upload of ONE table. One two-dimensional CSV file (currently limited to 100 MB). The size limitation aside, imagine being tasked with building one table with all of your company’s data…  I could probably stop there, but let's go on.  With your one table in hand, you now have to get approval to get your one table with ALL of your company’s data pushed outside of your company’s firewall into an LLM that they have no control over…  We can probably stop there.  The current alternative(more on this later) to the above would be that your company builds its own LLM. While theoretically possible, the complexities of training and fine-tuning the model, the expertise required and the enormous costs of doing so would only make that cost-effective for an extremely short list of companies.  But for the sake of understanding, let's take a step back and imagine your company is on that list.  But first, let’s start with some perspective. If we look back to the introduction of business intelligence tools in the early 2000s, the great value of those tools lies in their ability to provide non-technical, line-of-business people the ability to leverage their domain knowledge by enabling them to select, analyze and present data, without writing a stitch of code. Sound familiar?  Providing user-friendly means to analyze data is nothing new. It will always have incredible value. Indeed, it is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow. However, these tools have no use without domain knowledge. This applies to any data analysis, regardless of the tool(s) being used. Even if it's generative AI. Without domain knowledge, we do not know what questions to ask of our data. And even if the questions were provided to us, how do we interpret our findings?  And in my view, the greatest value of data analysis work lies in its ability to answer ad hoc questions. Unforeseen, mission-critical questions. Complex, multi-layered, nonlinear types of questions. Answering these questions requires domain knowledge.  For example, why did sales on our best-selling product just drop off a cliff? Our primary supplier just went out of business, what do we do? Why did our customer churn rate double last month? These are not straightforward types of questions that can follow an established decision tree.  What these few examples have in common is that they require immediate answers to situational questions that have never been asked before. And that is really the key. If you understand the construct of generative AI, its inability to answer questions of this nature is truly its Achilles heel in ever being able to replace data analysts fully.  To briefly summarize, generative AI utilizes existing data sets to ‘train’ an LLM to generate a probability-driven answer based on whatever training data it has been fed. And while you can continuously fine-tune your model with ever more precise data sets, how would you train your model on multi-layered, situational questions that have never been asked before?  It would be analogous to you starting a new job as a data analyst in an industry that you are not yet familiar with. And on day one, you are asked to urgently answer one of the questions above. Where would you even start? What data would you pull? How would you even know what all of the potential variables you would need to consider? And, even if you could somehow derive an answer, how would you know if it is correct?  It is for these reasons that I don’t foresee the role of data analyst ever being fully replaced by generative AI. However… generative AI, in its current state, already has many uses in the data analysis field and those uses will only continue to expand with ever-increasing functionality.  Current Potential Uses for Generative AI in Data Analysis  As of today, the highest and best use of generative AI in the data analysis field is its ability to both write code and in turn, explain the code it writes (which it does quite well). I’ve personally used it to help me write and understand Python code.  For those of you who are looking to enter the data analysis field, I could not encourage you enough to take advantage of generative AI to help you learn to code. It would have greatly speeded up my learning curve when I was first cutting my teeth in this field.  In another, truly exciting development for data analysts, generative AI has fueled the development of dedicated coding tools. GitHub has released its Copilot product, which can suggest coding solutions/improvements in real-time as you are writing it!  Earlier in this article, I referred to the potential hurdles companies would face in building their own LLMs. There is possibly one new alternative to that: Databricks has recently released an open-source LLM called ’ Dolly’. In theory, this could solve the issues of cost (being open source) and having to push your data outside of your company’s firewall. It’s a smaller-scale LLM, more suited for focused datasets.  I mention Dolly, primarily as an example of how quickly developments in the field of generative AI are moving and as a heads-up to how they may affect the data analysis field going forward.  As we have already seen, the evolution of AI will only continue to progress at light speed.  Conclusion  There is no doubt in my mind that generative AI will reshape the workflows in data analysis. Generally speaking, repetitive types of tasks or even analyses will in time be performed by generative AI. I could also see coding becoming more of a commodity, versus being a highly developed skill.  Based on the above, I believe that the prototypical data analyst in the future will possess business line-level domain knowledge combined with an ability to incorporate generative AI tools to help them be more efficient and productive with their time.  Lastly, on a personal note, I would encourage anyone reading this to embrace generative AI. Learn about it and use it both in your personal and business lives. With new APIs and plugins constantly being created, its reach and capabilities will only grow.  For better or worse.

In my CSV file, they are properly separated.Next, I want to train on both of them with the kNN and SVM models using 10-fold validation and output each models Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-Measure.

What I noticed is that If I use the """"Titanic Training"""" dataset from the samples, it correctly outputs all the performance criterion that I have mentioned above (Precision, Recall etc). So why is that? Also, could I use the Compare ROCs operator to do it instead of Cross Validation?I am circulating between youtube videos and the tutorials of Rapidminer for the last 8 hours to no avail.

This new release includes several important improvements to our automated machine learning (AutoML) functions, simplified governance controls, and more. You can access a complete set of documentation about Altair RapidMiner Cloud here. Also be sure to check out this Applications and Use Cases page for an introduction to important data science concepts.  Introduction to Altair® RapidMiner® Cloud 2023.0Improved AutoML Capabilities  Our guided user experience enables people who are new to machine learning to find clusters of similar records automatically. Advanced users can save time developing sophisticated models that include cluster analysis. Non-expert users like data analysts and citizen data scientists can deploy and integrate ML models in seconds using the pre-configured deployment settings we include in the product.  Auto-clustering: This is the latest advancement of the broader AutoML tools in Altair RapidMiner Cloud, including auto-machine learning, auto-feature engineering, and auto-forecasting. Many ML-related problems require models that can quickly identify hidden clusters of similar records within very large amounts of data. Users can pass the clustered information into the auto-machine learning tool for predictive modeling. It is easy to use for novices and improves productivity for advanced users.  One-click deployment of AutoML models: We have simplified the operationalization of predictive models trained with AutoML as REST API endpoints.  Simplified and Expanded Data Access Users can manage access to all data sources directly from within Altair RapidMiner Cloud.  The software supports Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Azure Data Lake (both gen1 and gen2), Google Cloud Storage, popular SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, SAP Sybase, HyperSQL DataBase (HSQLDB), and Salesforce. Users can also leverage data connections within workflows, allowing machine learning models to read from and write data to respective data sources.  Improved Workflow Scheduling Altair RapidMiner Cloud is more useful than ever in applications that require advanced levels of automation, including data engineering, ETL, ML model training or scoring, and more. You can now schedule workflows to run automatically at pre-defined times or at regular intervals using a simple dropdown menu or Cron expression. Users can also define in advance the computing resources to be allocated to their scheduled jobs.   Shorter Learning Curve New users can come up to speed and begin doing productive work faster than ever before using our expanded in-product, contextual help. Users can access help relevant to the screen they are using with a single click in the top-level navigation bar. This builds on the other help capabilities provided in the product, including get started checklists and guided tours, an integrated e-learning portal, and embedded, searchable documentation.",FALSE

This tutorial demonstrates the functionality of the JSON processing with jq extension.The first step is to install the extension from the Marketplace if you don't have it yet. Click the Extensions/Marketplace menu entry, and in the Marketplace window, enter JSON in the search box. Select the extension for installation, and let Studio restart itself when the installation is done.Let's play with a publicly available data set from the Vienna Open Data server.Here's a list of playgrounds in the city of Vienna, with some attributes and even geocoordinates:https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/bd8b518b-d812-46f9-b367-4c1b660cfc99 When you go there, you see a list of documents in different formats, we're obviously interested in the JSON document, with this URL.The simplest RapidMiner process to get the contents of this URL and process them with jq looks like this:In Open File, you set the resource type to URL, and paste the URL of the JSON resource. In Read Document uncheck """"extract text only"""", as we don't want to change the input. Then add a Process Document with jq operator and connect its input and output ports.By default, Process Document with jq is set up for JSON output, indenting (formatting) the resulting JSON document, and with the simplest jq expression """"."""", which just copies (and formats) the incoming document.So we get the first result from the process:The document contains a kind of a header (type: FeatureCollection and totalFeatures from the GeoJSON standard), and an array of """"features"""" (the playgrounds).We're interested in the name (ANL_NAME), the playground details (SPIELPLATZ_DETAIL), and the geocoordinates of every playground. To develop the jq expression, we go to jqplay.org and paste the JSON data into JSON field. The we interactively begin to develop the expression to select the data we want.The first step is """".features"""". This selects the features array (discarding the header), and returns every element as an object of one large array.If we change this to """".features[]"""", we get a list of different objects, which is better for further processing.In jq, we use the pipe symbol | for processing steps. Now we list the elements we want after a pipe. The expression is: .features[] | [.properties.ANL_NAME, .properties.SPIELPLATZ_DETAIL, .geometry.coordinates[0], .geometry.coordinates[1] ]This gives us a nice flat structure that we can easily process with RapidMiner, especially if we let the operator convert it to CSV. (Uncheck """"first row as names"""" in the Read CSV operator, and change the separator to comma.)The result is a normal RapidMiner example set:Check out the documentation of jq if you need to process even more complex documents. jq offers additional functionality like extracting a variable length array of values (like tags) to a table structure, or counting elements, regular expression replacements, etc.",FALSE

We will use cURL, a command line tool for sending and receiving files through URL syntax. It has many parameters but we only need two for now, further details can be found by typing """"curl -h"""" in the command line or through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL   Let us get started with a very simple process which trains a decision tree to classify customers. It is meant to be able to predict the """"Response"""" attribute.      A sample of the data is as follows:      For deployment, we have another process which imports the model built above on the data we have with known responses and applies it to data with unknown responses.        Please note how the """"Read Document"""" operator is connected to the imput port of the process canvas. This is so that it can receive data through the POST upload from the service we are going to create. This operator is not currently pointed to any file.   There is also a """"Cut Document"""" operator which is necessary for partitioning the JSON file to JSON documents per record so that the """"JSON to Data"""" operator can parse them. The """"JSON to Data"""" operator is meant to ingest collections of JSON documents, not a single file, that is why we cut the document into a collection using the following parameters:    Please note that in steps 1 to 4 above, we use the JsonPath notation to parse the file and the """"$."""" argument. With other files, this argument can get more complicated. It may be worth the time to research JsonPath notation online as well as regular expressions.   Before we create the service, bear in mind that the data we are going to pass for scoring does not have values in the response attribute, those values are going to be predicted.        Let us now create the service in Rapidminer Server:        There are no special parameters or macros, as long as it points to the correct process for deployment. We then test the service to get the URL which, in this case, is: http://RMUK-KBONIKOS:8080/api/rest/process/POSTtest?   We can use curl from the command line, which in Windows can be started from the Start menu by typing """"cmd"""" and then we can enter the follwoing curl command:   curl --user admin --upload-file C:\test.json http://<your server>:8080/api/rest/process/POSTtest?   Or,  curl --user admin --data {json data} http://<your server>:8080/api/rest/process/POSTtest?   The user in this case is """"admin"""" and the file is test.json and is saved in the C: drive, the path for the file can change. When this is executed, you will be asked for your password for the user and then you should get a list of scored records in XML in this case, this depends on the output format chosen when defining the service.      With the above help, you should be able to create a process and expose it as a service in Rapidminer Server and then test that is is able to receive JSON data or files through a POST upload and score and return the output.",FALSE

I can think of several scenarios where such techniques could be used.   In this article I shall describe some experiments I carried out with the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders over a two day period. There are 492 frauds out of a total 284,807 examples. Thus, the dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions. You can imagine that any such dataset would be highly unbalanced, as expected fraud or anomalous cases would only make up for a small percentage of the total transactions.   I carried out this analysis in two parts. First I under-sampled the dataset in Python by retaining all the fraud examples and by randomly selecting some amount of non-fraud examples such that in the final dataset the fraud cases had a good representation. In the second part, I used Rapidminer to develop models to predict the anomalous cases. Rapidminer is a GUI based platform for machine learning that makes it possible for you to design processes and workflows for building and evaluating models. You can even do so without a coding background and so I think it is a very useful tool for managers who want to apply these techniques quickly and realize value without having to struggle through excessive coding.   The original dataset itself can be downloaded from Kaggle at the link below [use this link].   As it is financial data, the features in the dataset are PCA transformations of the original features. So what you will see are only numerical values with no background information, the transactions are completely anonymous. The first column is the time in seconds, of each transaction from the first, I discarded this column in my analysis. Then there are 28 numerical features along with an Amount feature column which is the transaction amount. The final column is the Class in which the 1s are the fraud cases. This is the column that we would like our model to learn and be able to predict for new transactions.  Dataset preview  Now the problem in such unbalanced datasets is that there are very few 1s in the Class column. These are the fraud cases that we want to be able to learn and predict. However if your model simply predicts 0s for all, you would still get a very high accuracy >99% because most transactions are not fraud anyway, but you will not be detecting any of the anomalies. So instead of using the full dataset as is, I created a subset of the original dataset by well representing the fraud cases as an overall percentage of cases in the new dataset. This was done in Python as explained below.   # load required librariesfrom numpy import concatenatefrom pandas import read_csvfrom pandas import DataFramefrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScalerimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npnum_features = 30 #Number of features in the datasetlabel_feature = 'Class' #The column in dataset that model is being built to predict   The above libraries are required for this code   # Reading in the dataset which is in .csv format, has column headings and has an index columndataset = read_csv(""""creditcard2.csv"""", header = 0, index_col = 0, squeeze = True, usecols = (i for i in range(0, num_features+1))) Then the original .csv file of the Kaggle dataset is read, the first column have Time data is treated as an index column. This column only carries time information from the first transaction in the dataset and so I don’t think it is a useful feature that can be used for prediction.   scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-1, 1))dataset['normAmount'] = scaler.fit_transform(dataset['Amount'].reshape(-1, 1))dataset = dataset.drop(['Amount'],axis=1)   Then I have used the MinMaxScaler to normalize the Amount column, which otherwise has a very different range of values as compared to the other columns. This is general good practice before using the data for machine learning. This new normalized column for Amount is retained and the original Amount column is dropped.   # Move label column to the end of datasetcols_at_end = [label_feature]dataset = dataset[[c for c in dataset if c not in cols_at_end] + [c for c in cols_at_end if c in dataset]]   I generally use the above code to move the label column to the end of the dataset, it makes it easy to read and to separate it out if required. In this case it is already at the end so the above code makes no change.   # Number of datapoints belonging to the minority classnumber_fraud = len(dataset[dataset.Class == 1])fraud_indices = np.array(dataset[dataset.Class == 1].index)# Finding out the indices of the normal classnormal_indices = dataset[dataset.Class == 0].index# Out of the normal indices, randomly select fraud number of occurencesrandom_normal_indices = np.random.choice(normal_indices, number_fraud, replace = False)random_normal_indices = np.array(random_normal_indices)# Appending the 2 sets of indicesunder_sample_indices = np.concatenate([fraud_indices, random_normal_indices])# Under sample dataset from the selected indicesunder_sample_data = dataset.loc[under_sample_indices,:]   The above code gets the number of fraud cases in the original dataset and then selects randomly an equal number of non-fraud examples to build a 50:50 under sampled dataset. If you look closely the above code has an error. It is to do with the .loc operand, it does not exactly perform what we are intending and I was unable to resolve this. But I was still getting an under sampled dataset with close to 28% representation of fraud cases and so I went ahead. Maybe at some future point I can resolve this error.   under_sample_data.to_csv('Undersampled.csv', encoding='utf-8', index=False)   Finally we export the under sampled dataset into a .csv file which will be used in Rapidminer for the remainder of the analysis. So from here on we are working in Rapidminer Studio.   RapidMiner process flow   The process implemented in RapidMiner is shown above (you can also open it directly in RapidMiner here). With the RapidMiner interface it is pretty easy to see and understand what is happening. The operators used above are drag and drop, making it very easy to implement. We make a 80:20 split of the under sampled dataset with shuffling, and use multiple copies of this to train multiple predictors. Each of the learnt model is applied on the 20% validation split and the results obtained. I have also used the Self Organising Map (SOM) for visualisation operator to actually visualize the learnt models.   I have compared 4 techniques: Logistic regression, which is the default choice for such binomial classification tasks, a Neural Network, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. The process runs in under one minute and the results are given below:               From the above results it can be seen that each of the models are doing a really good job with their predictions. The accuracy is pretty good. The logistic regression is the best performer. So its really that simple to build an anomaly detection system! Some cases of frauds are being missed out and some further fine tuning may be required.   The Self Organizing Maps for visualization operators help visualize the learnt models by reducing them to a two dimensional space. The summary of the four visualizations are shown below, with each dot representing the predicted class. The boundaries can be clearly observed, showing the learnt classification. You can also observe the dots that are bright orange in color or light blue, these are the few cases of erroneous predictions.   SOM visualizations   With this there is one final step to be completed and that is to use the entire dataset and apply the learnt models and see how it performs for the full data. The process is similar to the Rapidminer process shown above except that instead of the 20% split data copies you use the original dataset. The studio version can only work on 10,000 datapoints but that should be good enough. The results obtained are below.               It can be seen that while the Logistic regression and Neural network model capture all fraud cases they also predict false positives, which may lead to large number of investigation of non-fraud cases. While the Decision Tree and SVM models make far fewer false positive predictions they do also miss out one actual fraud case. One will have to make a call on which model to use based on these results. Perhaps investigations can be carried out depending on the transaction amount, or maybe use an ensemble of models for prediction.   This technique can be applied to other areas — anomalous applications for insurance, anomalous checklist filling etc. The true difficulty lies in capturing the right data that can make good features as part of the dataset used for training, and this is where planning and creativity is required.   Hope this article has been an interesting read!   Vinay Arun",FALSE

This may be helped by retraining the algorithm or by finding a different one that performs better with the data as it has evolved.   To achieve the above, we can use the """"Compare Models"""" operator to build models by different algortithms, compare their performance and keep a record of the performance and parameters    The best way to learn about this capability is to open the tutorial process which is bundled with the operator. Just drop the Compare Models operator onto the canvas, switch to the Help panel and navigate to the tutorial process. You should see the same process as above.   The data used comes from one of the bundled data sets and has """"Play"""" set as the target variable:    Then a Multiply operator is used and three different predictive models are built, in this case, using default parameters but those can be optimised if necessary. The models produced are collected by the Collection operator which passes them to the """"Compare Models"""" operation for Comparison.      The """"Compare Models"""" operator requires two parameters, a location to save the results and a date format and now we can get to the most interesting part, the output:      We can obtain models and their performances, neatly arranged under folders that bear the date and time in the format we specified.   There is also a performance record as a data source which can then be imported into a process to be used as input for further actions such as those from Process Control operators undel Utilities.",FALSE

"amitpathak","February 26, 2023 5:07AM","Term Frequencies and TF-IDF: How are these calculated?","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/46333/term-frequencies-and-tf-idf-how-are-these-calculated","Term Frequencies and TF-IDF: How are these calculated?   Are you are like me – using """"Process Documents"""" for a long time but never truly understood what those numbers are? Or perhaps just a math geek who enjoys vector analysis? Either way, relax for a moment while I walk you through a step-by-step example of exactly how Term Occurrences, Term Frequencies (TF), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequencies (TF-IDF) work in RapidMiner...   Set Up Example   We're going to start with a VERY simple example: two short documents in one corpus. Document 1 says """"This is a report about data mining and text mining"""" and Document 2 says """"This is a text about video analysis"""".  I am going to combine these two documents and run them through """"Process Documents"""" with Tokenization, Transform Cases, and Filter Stopwords (English):Main process   Inside """"Process Documents""""Results without word vectors   Term Occurrences   This is the most basic word token vectorization you can do. It simply counts the word token occurrences in each document to create a """"term occurrence word vector"""":   Term Occurrences for sample corpus of 2 documents Binary Term Occurrences   This is also rather straightforward. The only difference is that the only options are 0 and 1. Hence you will see that the only change is in Document 1, RapidMiner changes the """"2"""" to a """"1"""", simply indicating that there is at least one occurrence of the word token """"mining"""".   Binary Term Occurrences for sample corpus of 2 documents   Term Frequencies   This is where things get interesting. At the most basic level, Term Frequency (TF) is simply the ratio of the occurrence of each word token to the total number of word tokens in the document. First I use the Extract Token Number operator inside the Process Documents to get the total number of word tokens in each document:   Results from using the """"Extract Token Number"""" in the Process Documents operator to get the token count for each document in the corpus Now Term Frequencies should make sense:   Term Frequencies for sample corpus of 2 documents But you may notice that this is NOT what RapidMiner gives you when you select """"Term Frequencies"""" in the """"Vector Creation"""" parameter:   RapidMiner result for Term Frequencies with sample corpus of 2 documents Why? Because the term frequency word vectors that are shown in RapidMiner are normalized vectors. This is exactly the same as unit vector normalization that you may have seen in physics classes.  In broad brush strokes, the norm of a (Euclidean) vector is its length or size. If you have a 1x2 vector, you can find the norm by simple Pythagorean Theorem. For a 1x6 vector like each document above, you use Pythagorean Theorem but in 6-dimensional space.  Hence the norm of the first document term frequency vector is:   SQRT [ (0)^2 + (0.200)^2 + (0.400)^2 + (0.200)^2 + (0.200)^2 + (0)^2 ] = 0.529  and the second document term frequency vector is:   SQRT [ (0.333)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0.333)^2 + (0.333)^2 ] = 0.577 In order to look at all the documents equally, we want all the document vectors to have the same length. So we divide each document term frequency vector by its respective norm to get a """"document term frequency unit vector"""" – also called a normalized term frequency vector.   So if we divide each term frequency in each document term frequency vector by its norm:   0 / 0.529 = 0           0.200 / 0.529 = 0.378     0.400 / 0.529 = 0.756     0.200 / 0.529 = 0.378 ....0.333 / 0.577 = 0.577   0 / 0.577 = 0             0 / 0.577 = 0             0 / 0.577 = 0 ....   we will get normalized term frequency vectors for each document – exactly what RapidMiner shows.     RapidMiner result for Term Frequencies with sample corpus of 2 documents Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)   OK but why go beyond TFs at all? Well the problem with TFs is that they only look at word tokens relative to other word tokens in a single document, not relative to the entire corpus. And usually in text mining you want to train your ML model on a large number of documents, not one.  Hence finding word tokens that are particularly strong among many documents is far more important than each document in isolation.   But what is strong? It is exactly like weighting attributes in normal machine learning; word tokens that are able to distinguish one document from another should be weighted heavier than others that do not provide this insight, i.e. we weight a word token's uniqueness rather than its popularity.   Say you had a library of books and wished to train a model that classified books based on """"has animals"""" vs """"has no animals"""".  Clearly word tokens like """"tiger"""", """"elephant"""" and """"bear"""" are far more important than word tokens like """"if"""", """"or"""" and """"because"""".  So we call this unique strength factor an inverse document frequency: the less frequent it occurs, the stronger it should be.   So let's look at our corpus. We have two documents with a total of six unique word tokens: analysis, data, mining, report, text, and video. Note that the word token """"text"""" occurs in both documents – its predictive strength should not be as large as the other word tokens which are unique to each document.  We could do something as simple as this:   analysis: 1 out of 2 documents = 1/2data: 1 out of 2 documents = 1/2mining: 1 out of 2 documents = 1/2report: 1 out of 2 documents = 1/2text: 2 out of 2 documents = 2/2video: 1 out of 2 documents = 1/2   but we want """"text"""" to be stronger, so let's use exponents:   analysis: 1 out of 2 documents = e^(1/2) = 1.649data: 1 out of 2 documents = e^(1/2) = 1.649mining: 1 out of 2 documents = e^(1/2) = 1.649report: 1 out of 2 documents = e^(1/2) = 1.649text: 2 out of 2 documents = e^(2/2) = 2.718video: 1 out of 2 documents = e^(1/2) = 1.649   but that's not a good idea. Imagine if you had 100 documents and only one had """"video""""; the others are in 99 out of the 100 documents and hence far less important; you would want """"video"""" to be very heavily weighted against them.  This does not work well at all.   analysis: 99 out of 100 documents = e^(99 / 100) = 2.691data: 99 out of 100 documents = e^(99 / 100) = 2.691mining: 99 out of 100 documents = e^(99 / 100) = 2.691report: 99 out of 100 documents = e^(99 / 100) = 2.691text: 99 out of 100 documents = e^(99 / 100) = 2.691video: 1 out of 100 documents = e^(1 / 100) = 1.01   However if you flip it around and find ln of the reciprocal, it works like you would expect:   analysis: 99 out of 100 documents = ln (100 / 99) = ln 1.01 = 0.01data: 99 out of 100 documents = ln (100 / 99) = ln 1.01 = 0.01mining: 99 out of 100 documents = ln (100 / 99) = ln 1.01 = 0.01report: 99 out of 100 documents = ln (100 / 99) = ln 1.01 = 0.01text: 99 out of 100 documents = ln (100 / 99) = ln 1.01 = 0.01video: 1 out of 100 documents = ln (100 / 1) = ln 100 = 4.605  here the word token """"video"""" is weighted approximately 461 times heavier than the other word tokens. That makes sense.   Now let's look at our original example with our one IDF vector. As you can see, the word token """"text"""" has much less strength than the others who all have equal strength (or weight), as it should be.   analysis: 1 out of 2 documents = ln (2 / 1) = 0.693data: 1 out of 2 documents = ln (2 / 1) = 0.693mining: 1 out of 2 documents = ln (2 / 1) = 0.693report: 1 out of 2 documents = ln (2 / 1) = 0.693text: 2 out of 2 documents = ln (2 / 2) = 0video: 1 out of 2 documents = ln (2 / 1) = 0.693∴IDF vector = (0.693   0.693   0.693   0.693   0   0.693) Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)   So now let's put it all together by multiplying each term frequency vectors by the inverse document frequency vector (represented as a diagonal matrix):   Document 1 TF-IDF:(0   0.2   0.4   0.2   0.2   0)    x    (0.693      0        0        0        0       0  )                                        (  0      0.693      0        0        0       0  )                                        (  0        0      0.693      0        0       0  )                                        (  0        0        0        0        0       0  )                                                                                         (  0        0        0        0      0.693     0  )                                        (  0        0        0        0        0     0.693)= (0   0.138   0.277   0.138   0   0)Document 2 TF-IDF:(0.333   0   0   0   0.333   0.333) x   (0.693      0        0        0        0       0  )                                        (  0      0.693      0        0        0       0  )                                        (  0        0      0.693      0        0       0  )                                        (  0        0        0        0        0       0  )                                                                                         (  0        0        0        0      0.693     0  )                                        (  0        0        0        0        0     0.693)= (0.231    0    0    0    0    0.231)    And now all that is left is to normalize these TF-IDF vectors like we did for TF:   SQRT [ (0)^2 + (0.138)^2 + (0.277)^2 + (0.138)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 ] = 0.340SQRT [ (0.231)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0.231)^2 ] = 0.327  Document 1: 0 / 0.340 = 0           0.138 / 0.340 = 0.408     0.277 / 0.340 = 0.816     0.138 / 0.340 = 0.408 ....Document 2: 0.231 / 0.327 = 0.707   0 / 0.327 = 0             0 / 0.327 = 0             0 / 0.327 = 0 ....   Which is exactly what RapidMiner gives us for TF-IDF!   RapidMiner result for TF-IDF with sample corpus of 2 documents  I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.   Scott",FALSE

In my training set, I have two folders, folder 1 including around 1000 images and folder 2 around 400 images (all images look like pac man maze, colored 224*224 pixels). Images in Folder 1 are examples of a specific strategy (called strategy 1), and folder 2 represents a different strategy (called strategy 2). I used image augmentation to generate more images for both folders (used cropping and rotation) and currently folder 1 and 2 contains 1900 images each. For the test set, I randomly picked 20 images from each folder.  I have attached my solution for this binary classification task. As you can see in the process, I import a pre-trained model of Resnet 50 for transfer learning. To fine-tune the model, I freeze up to """"avg_pool"""" and remove """"flatten_1"""" and """"fc1000"""". I added fully connected, dropout, fully connected, dropout, and output layers to retrain the model.  The result that I get (after training 14 hours on a CPU, 16 GB RAM) is the prediction of only one of the classes, for instance, class strategy 1 or class strategy 2 (see attached). My questions:  1) should I change the way I retrain the Resnet 50 (e.g., freezing or retraining more/less layers) so the model can correctly predict the classes? if so, how?  2) when placing the """"import existing model"""" and """"fine-tune model"""" inside a split or cross-validation it gives errors complaining about tensor input. How should I revise the solution to have the model cross-validated?  3) any suggestions on other pre-trained models like VGGs and how to adjust their architecture (freeze, retrain, etc.) to possibly get better results in a shorter time?

Instead, it shows like a multi-label classification, then seems like when testing it is not doing a Hierarchical Classification.Could you please help what's the correct form to use Hierarchical Classificator, with Cross-Validation (k-folds) with 70 % for training and 30% for testing?This is a modified example with the Iris-Dataset.",FALSE

Instead of applying data imputation techniques, I believe it will be better to find a way to compute support and confidence metrics by ignoring the missing values. For example if for item A, I have 4 occurencies out of 10 transactions and 2 of them are missing, then the support should be 4/8 instead of 4/10. And we will do this for all itemsets. I tried to edit the open source code of the fpgrowth algorithm from the mlxtend library, but I see that's very hard to do the code is very abstract in general. Has anyone found a way on how to solve this issue? I know @MattTC13 made exactly the same question on this forum, a few years ago if you have a solution it would be great for you to share it!",FALSE

However, for me this is rather not possible by going to File and choosing Import process. Althought RM enables the import of the chosen file, and one can see it is computing something in the lower right corner, however, there is nothing in my Repository as the result. As I have seen at some point on the progress line the inscription Recommendations update, it occured me to update and install everything I was able to. But Import Process still does not work.   Sometimes simple copy/paste onto the desired repository folder is possible (and the system presents an floppy disc icon, asking if I want to store the copied process there). However, this is rather more impossible than it is possible.

This is completely counterintuitive and impedes effective interpretation of the tree. Here is an illustration to make this point clearer:Take the top branch, for example, the split on """"jean"""". Everything where jean is > 0.126 is on the left, whereas everything where jean is ⩽ 0.126 is on the right. This is counterintuitive. I would expect that the left branch would be jean ⩽ 0.126 and the right branch would be jean > 0.126. This counterintuitive ordering is the case throughout the regression tree.Is there a way to automatically flip the branch order by default? If not, I would like RapidMiner to reverse the order by default, since I think the reverse would make sense to most users. However, if there is a use case for the present default order, then perhaps there could be an option somewhere for the user to specify the preferred order.Could anyone please help me with this, or how can I turn this into a feature request (or more like a minor bug fix, in my opinion).",FALSE

I have to extract from these reports sentences that contains specific words (from a wordlist) and create a document with all the selected sentences, which will be used later for further analysis. For that I used first a """"read document"""" operator. Then I used a """"process document"""" operator that contains a tokenize operator (based on linguistic sentences). After (still inside the process documents operator), I used the filter tokens by content and I put in the string parameter the specific words that I want in the retained sentences. My problem is that I can't put all the selected sentences in a list where they can be read easily seperatly. Each selected sentence becomes an attribute. I think my problem is not complicated but I can't find an answer on the forum that solves my problem. I don't know much about data and how to use Rapidminer to do textmining (first time). I would like to apologize because it is possible that the answer is on the forum and I am the one who is doing the research wrong. Thank you!",FALSE

I also hope that my question is not common knowledge for everyone here.I basically worked around my problem already, but I am really really curious why this happens and if this is normal.This morning I have been trying to work with large numbers that are 18 digits long. I read the data from an Excel file as """"real"""", Before i changed the import of these numbers to """"polynominal"""". Now something interesting happens to those numbers in the Results tab when importing them as real:The example number in my Results tab is portrayed as: 123456789112345670 If you select the cell and Focus on it, the number may be something like this: 123456789112345668If you copy the cell without focussing on it, it pastes as: 1.2345678911234567E17Now if you save it as a csv or as an Excel file it also rounds the digits to 1.2345678911234567E17If you use the operator Numercial to Polynominal the number will be rounded to 123456789112345670 instead of writing 123456789112345668Is this intentional? Has this something to do with the amount of bits used in storing the real number? Shouldnt be the max real number here somewhere around +/-E32 or smth?Thanks to the community and everyone working at RapidMiner for this exciting environment full of learning and passion about the topic of data science!Best regards!",FALSE

So I would like to get a longer history in order to try some predictions on it.  I have worked out how to get the last value of the UNIX time stamp from the first run, and then use that in a loop as the starting point for a second run and merge both sets of data to one file to get 4000 hours. The problem is I cant work out how to loop gain and change the value for a more sucessive times each loop. to get more history. -  The data is hour based ticker price, from cryptocompare limited to 2000 hours per call, It is posible to insert the value from the earliest UNIX time stamp date from the first run to complete sucessive runs to get earlier data.&limit=2000&toTs={the earliest timestamp received}https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/histohour?fsym=%{fsym}&amp;tsym=%{tsym}&amp;limit=%{limit}&amp;toTs=%{toTs}&api_key={api_key}Process attached(i have removed my API) you can get one free to test it.  from here https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Historical&cat=dataHistohourAny help appreciated - thanks, Lee",FALSE

Here are the change logs:Anomaly Extension (4.0.0, only available with RM 9.10.10 released July 15th):=== 3.3.1 ===* Fixed a bug in Detect Outlier (TS), were z-scores wouldn't work with a reference set.* Fixed a bug in Detect Outlier (TS), were algorithms won't work if the reference set is smaller than the test set=== 4.0.0 ===Please be aware that this release is not backwards compatible, since attributes got new names!* Anomaly models are now serialized using JSON, not java serialization* Normal Anomaly models are now IOTablePredictionModels, just like any other learner (except clustering)* Since Anomaly models are now IOTablePredictionModels their response is prediction, not a score* Univariate models are still Preprocessing models, but their main score is called prediction. all other scores are called prediction(attributeName)* Univariate models are now stating the correct covered attributes in their descriptionNote: 3.3.1 was never released.Interpretations Extension (0.0.6)Changes in 0.6.0----------------* Generate Interpretation now supports IOTablePrediction Models. Those are (as of RM 9.10.10):    - Function Fitting    - XGBoost    - Anomaly Models from Anomaly Extension (version 4.0+)* Fixed a bug where Generate Interpretation fails if you provide a python based classification model which does not provide a confidence. You now get a proper error message.This means you can now interpret your anomaly models!Admin Extension (1.4.1)Changes in 1.4.1----------------* Run Job (AI Hub) is not returning cronExpression, nextFireTime and lastFireTime anymore, since they are schedule related.* Deploy Project (AI Hub) is now returning a table with the deployment information.* RTSA URLs need to end with / now.* Added a test if the RTSA URL is ending with / or not* The test button of RTSA connection is now doing a real test.* Renamed Call Webservice (RTSA) to Call Endpoint (RTSA)* Renamed Get Deployments (RTSA) to Get Endpoints (RTSA)* Rename repository name parameter to project name in Deploy Project (RTSA).* Read Log (AI Hub) is renamed to Get Log (AI Hub)* Enhanced Documentation of all operatorsAs usual: Let us know if we can help you with anything!Happy mining everybody!",FALSE

My idea was to do N/2 clusters to create pairs, but as I don't know how to do balanced clusters or how to force the minimum size of a cluster to 2 items, the output was N/2 clusters but unfortunatelly there weren't 2 items in each, creating some clusters with i.e. 3 items and some with 1 item in it.)Thank you for all of your advices (the simpler solution the better   ) !",FALSE

I saw today that there is a one year license for students, a license that can be helpful for a new course that I am taking in my master's degree called Data Analytics in Sustainable Development, and for my thesis. Nevertheless, I haven't been able to install the educational license, so I was wondering if the reason could be that I already used a free trial. If it`s possible to use the educational license it would be great. So the question is, how can I install the educational license if the process described in the web page has not worked?",FALSE

In other words, how do I:1) Print the results of the GSP analysis such that I can review the rows from my dataset that were identified as a part of each frequent sequence therefore allowing me to anectdotally identify and eliminate subsequences that are a part of parent sequences.2) Run a post-processing step that joins the daughter sequences before running the same process that I had previously written to identify whether the sequences meet the appropriate criterion (support, etc.,). This is following advice by Perrera and Colleagues, (2008) <Apparently I am too novice to link the article (or even leave the URL). Therefore, the title of the article is: """"Clustering and Sequential Pattern Mining of Online Collaborative Learning Data"""" in IEEE>. The intention of this join step is to eliminate subsequences from the results so that only parent sequences remain. To quote Perrera et al., """"A sequence s1 joins with s2 if the subsequence obtained by dropping the first item of s1 is the same as the subsequence obtained by dropping the last item of s2. For example, <a; b; c; d> is a 4-sequence candidate of the 3-sequences <a; b; c> and <b; c; d>."""" (p 766). Any advice/guidance is appreciated. If RapidMiner is not an appropriate tool for such an analysis, I am happy to receive direction with advise using R or another tool. Furthermore, if this question has already been answered elsewhere, please accept my apologies by linking the appropriate page.Thank you!Joel",FALSE

For validation I chose the RMSE, the relative error and the squared correlation (R squared). I read that the R squared gets better as more attributes are chosen. To prevent this, I read that the adjusted R squared should be chosen. Is this possible with RapidMiner Studio or is this already the adjusted R squared?To improve my model I also tested with the """"Select attributes"""" operator and noticed the following:When I selected all attributes I had this performance:Case 1Linear Regression (RMSE 0,8 I Relative Error 14,2 I R squared 0,63)Neural Net (RMSE 0,86 I RF 15,91 I R squared 0,65)Deep Learning (RMSE 0,78 I RF 11,72 I R squared 0,68)In this case the Deep Learning should be the best model. Now I removed some attributes for modeling and got the following results:Case 2Linear Regression (RMSE 0,79 I Relative Error 14,0 I R squared 0,68)Neural Net (RMSE 0,89 I RF 17,29 I R squared 0,66)Deep Learning (RMSE 0,79 I RF 13,19 I R squared 0,65)I do not really know if the Linear Regression in second case is the better model as the Deep Learning in first case (R squared got better but Relative Error got worse). Can somebody help?Thanks a lot!",FALSE

Each row has a search ID (so one customer can have multiple searches). A search is a hotel which has several properties like location, price per night, star rating etc. Attributes are thus for example how many nights the search was for, how many adults would join the stay, what the star rating of the hotel is etc. The outcome variable that I want to predict is whether the customer will book or not. This attribute is already included in the dataset and is set to label. Additionally, I would like to take into account the chance a customer will click on a hotel, which is also a binary attribute in the dataset (clicked yes/no). I produced a k-means cluster with rapid miner studio, by:1. set role of attribute booked (yes/no) to label2. getting a sample of the data (20%)3. selecting attributes which we think are useful4. normalize the data5. transform the data that are nominal into numerical data6. apply the k-means clustering with k=3, 100 runs, add cluster as attribute to the data and all other default settings7. apply performance measure for cluster distanceNow I want to make a prediction on the label booked (y/n) based on these clusters. It has to become a list with search ID and the chance that this customer books the hotel of this search.

So far RapidMiner users had the option to use Explain Predictions as their method to understand WHY a model predicted the way it did. The Explain Predictions operator uses an algorithm by @IngoRM  which is focused around best speed, understand-ability and application on a range of use cases as well as data types.  The new operator adds the known algorithms of LIME, Shapely and SHAP to the mix. The operator Generate Interpretations has a very similar interface to the familiar Explain Predictions. In fact it also embeds Explain Predictions so that you can switch between different algorithms and get different ‘opinions’ on your predictions.  Please be aware that this is a first alpha release of the extension. We are continuously working on improving it. We appreciate every feedback!     Thanks! Philipp & Martin",FALSE

We explained that we did not report them for easy understanding. However, we were told that the settings are very sensitive and important to report when machine learning is utilized. For instance, the number of neurons (or, hidden layers) in NN makes a huge difference in the prediction rate. In terms of gradient boosting, which condition (e.g., sci-kit learn, extreme boosting, etc) was utilized? In the case of a random forest, how many trees were set as the range to be selected?While I look forward to insightful replies from community members here, I'd also welcome and would be more than happy if I could be referred to any resources or publication that can help me with this specific enquiry.TIA",FALSE

She doesn't do anything different than when I do it, but for me it works correctly. Any ideas on why this might be happening? She has header row checked and set as 1, semicolon selected as the column separator, and use quotes checked. Thank you!Connie",FALSE

It is the essay type answers that need help.  There were four questions that asked about technology, financing, monthly costs and one open-ended question. There is about 120 answers to each question and I'd like to get results summarized by the industry that answered. For example...government employees hated technology, while business owners loved it, and zoologists were neutral.   I'd also like to capture themes if they exist. Such as the business owners who loved technology also said 3D printing was the solution, while zoologists said technology might be OK, but the cost really needs to come down first.   The answers aren't long (about 40 pages of reading total), so I can just read them to do this, but learning a new software skill would be great. I did get the main spreadsheet loaded just fine and the data is there (just two columns, the industry and the answer). I did get #of answers by industry and the Wordcloud to work, but the Wordcloud was a mess and didn't pull words from the answers, it just plotted the answers.  So far, I must not have located the right video tutorials. Perhaps someone can point me in the direction of a good one you have for this concept (analyze essay answers)? I searched the questions here and found some answers, but they seemed tooo complex for this simple operation.   In the end visualization would be great as well, but not essential.

We need to be able to solve it to produce models. It’s not an easy technique though. Feature Selection requires heuristic processes to find an optimal machine learning subset.  In the previous post I discussed the brute force algorithm as well as forward selection and backward elimination which were both not a great fit. What other options are there? We can use one of the most common optimization algorithms for multi-modal fitness landscapes; evolutionary algorithms.  How do Evolutionary Algorithms work?  Evolutionary algorithm is a generic optimization technique mimicking the ideas of natural evolution. There are three basic concepts in play. First, parents create offspring (crossover). Second, there is a chance that individuals undergo small changes (mutation). And third, the likelihood for survival is higher for fitter individuals (selection).  We now know that we can represent possible attribute subsets with bit vectors. We can represent the selection of all attributes of a data set which consists of 10 attributes in total such as (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1). A bit vector for the subset which only uses the third attribute would be (0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) instead.  The first step of an evolutionary algorithm is to create a population of individuals. This population will evolve over time. We call this the initialization phase of the evolutionary algorithm. The individuals in our starting population are randomly generated. And each individual is a bit vector like those described above. We create individuals by tossing a coin for each available attribute. Depending on the result we either include the attribute in this individual or not. There are no fixed rules for the size of a starting population. However, we should have at least 2 individuals in the population if we want to do crossover. A good rule of thumb is to use between 5% and 30% of the number of attributes as population size.  After we create the initial population, there is a series of steps we need to keep performing. That is until we reach a stopping criterion. The image below depicts one possible way to implement such a loop. Please note that there are different approaches for the implementation of evolutionary algorithms. Some people prefer to perform the selection only for crossover. Others first select a new generation and perform crossover afterwards. Some people mutate only the offspring, but others also mutate parents. In my experience, the exact details of the algorithm have only little effect on how well they perform so I will explain only one variant below.    Step one  The first step is to pick parents from our population for crossover. I prefer to randomly pick parents from my population until I use all parents in exactly one crossover. Since the selection of survivors happens directly before (see below), we do not need to use the fitness for the parent selection. The selection step will already make sure that we mate only fitter parents in the next generation. There are many variants to implement this.  There are also many variants for the actual crossover. The variant in the picture above uses a single split point at the same position for both parent bit vectors. We create the offspring by using the front part from the first parent combined with the back part of the second parent and vice versa. Crossover can lead to large jumps in the fitness landscape. These jumps allow evolutionary algorithms to cope much better with multi-modal fitness landscapes. They simply have less likelihood to get stuck in a local extremum.  Step two  The next step is to perform mutation. Mutation means that we flip a single bit from 0 to 1 or the other way around. Many people only mutate the offspring of crossover, but I prefer to also mutate the parents. Please note that sometimes there is no mutation at all anyway. The likelihood for flipping the selection of a single attribute is 1 / m if m is the number of attributes. That means that we flip on average one attribute for each individual in the mutation. Mutation leads to a small movement in the fitness landscape. It can be useful to climb up towards a close-by extremum in the landscape. Finally, we can decide if we want to keep the original individuals as well or only keep the mutated individuals. I often keep both.  If we do decide to keep the original and the mutated individuals, then our population size is now 4 times bigger. We first created two new offspring from each pair of parents which doubled the population size. And then we created one mutation for each individual which doubles that population size again. In the next step, we should bring the population size down again to a smaller number. And we should prefer fitter individuals for survival while we are doing this.  Step three  But first we will evaluate all individuals in our current population. We call this the evaluation phase of the evolutionary algorithm. We can, for example, use the accuracy of a cross-validated model trained on this feature subset. We store those accuracies together with the individuals, so we can perform a fitness-driven selection in the next step.  Step four  The last step in our iterative process is selection. This step implements the concept of “survival of the fittest”. That means that individuals, i.e. attribute subsets, which lead to models with a higher accuracy should have a higher likelihood to survive. And survivors build the basis for new attribute sets in the next generation. There are many ways of performing a selection. We will in fact see in my next blog post that we have several interesting options for solving the feature selection problem in even better ways. But for now, we go with one of the most widely used selection schemes, namely tournament selection.  For tournament selection we pit a small group of individuals against each other. The fittest one of the group survives and makes it into the next generation. We use sampling with replacement for creating our tournament groups. This means that individuals can be also selected multiple times. We keep pitting individuals until the population of the next generation has reached the desired size again.  The group size has some impact on how likely it is that weaker individuals have a chance to survive. If the size of the tournament is equal to the population size, only the fittest individual will survive. But with a tournament size of only 2, even weaker individuals have a chance if they are up against another weak candidate. We can adapt the so-called selection pressure by picking different values for the tournament size. But be careful: too large and the algorithm might become too greedy. This increases the likelihood for sub-optimal results. But if the tournament size is too low, the optimization runs longer.  The loop ends when we meet a stopping criterion. This can be a maximum number of generations or the fact that there was no improvement any longer for some time. Or the optimization reached a time limit. But whatever the reason was, we deliver the best individual so far as result.  How can we easily use Evolutionary Feature Selection?  Let’s discuss how we can setup those different heuristics for feature selection in RapidMiner. [The RapidMiner processes can be downloaded by clicking on the button at the end of this post.]  There have been numerous papers showing that evolutionary feature selection is effective. In this blog post, we want to show that the results of each of the different approaches can differ. We will use a single data set. Keep in mind that the approaches are heuristics and results can be completely different for other data sets, but in practice we will often see patterns like those we will discuss below.  The data set we will analyze is the Sonar data. It has 208 examples (rows, observations, cases…) and each one is a frequency spectrum of objects in the water. In total, we have 60 different frequency bands which form the attributes of our data set. Our goal is to detect from the frequency spectrum of an object if this object is a rock or a naval mine. The image below shows a visualization of the data in a parallel plot. Each line in this chart is representing one example in the data set. The color specifies if the corresponding object is a rock (blue) or a mine (red).    As we can see, this is a pretty hard task, but there are certain areas in the frequency spectrum where the two classes differ a bit more. These areas are even easier to see in the deviation chart below. This chart only shows the mean values for each attribute of both classes. The transparent regions represent the standard deviations of the attributes for each class.    There are 4 different areas of the frequency spectrum where the two classes differ most. Those are the areas around attribute 11, attribute 20, attribute 35, and attribute 45. We saw in the first image that a single area will be sufficient to find a good model. But some combination of attributes in those areas should help a lot to get over the noise.  Process 1: Cross-validation of Naïve Bayes on Complete Data (Benchmark)  Before we do any feature selection, let’s first establish a benchmark by evaluating how well our model works on the complete data set. We will use Naïve Bayes as model type for the experiments here. And we will evaluate all models with the same 5-fold cross-validation. This means that there is no impact from different data splits during our experiments. We can do this in RapidMiner by defining a local random seed for the cross-validation operator.  As mentioned before, the process can be found at the end of this blog post. We achieve 67.83% accuracy on the Sonar data set with Naïve Bayes. And of course, we expect that feature selection will improve the accuracy even further. We will not try the brute force approach here though. For the 60 attributes (frequency bands) of our data set, we would end up with 260 – 1 = 1,152,921,504,606,849,999 combinations.  Process 2: Forward Selection  The next experiment we perform is a forward selection approach. We use the same 5-fold cross-validation as used above to evaluate the performance of each attribute subset. The optimization stopped already after 4 rounds and delivered attributes 12, 15, 17, and 18. The accuracy of this subset was 77.43%. This is much higher than our benchmark without any feature selection. But another thing is worth noticing. The feature selection has only selected attributes from the left two areas out of the 4 relevant areas of the frequency spectrum. The right two areas have not made it into the result. The forward selection simply stopped before after running into a local extremum. Process 3: Backward Elimination We will now try backward elimination as an alternative as it might do a better job in finding a good model considering all four important areas of the frequency spectrum. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. This algorithm only removed 8 out of the 60 attributes from the data set. All other noise attributes stayed in the data set before the backward elimination was running into the first local extremum. The lower accuracy of only 73.12% should not come as a result then, although it is still better than using the full data. At least we can see that getting rid of those 8 attributes paid off already. But there is still too much noise in the data which covers the actual signals.  Process 4: Evolutionary Feature Selection  Lastly, let’s look at the evolutionary approach for feature selection. We use a population size of 20 and stop the optimization after a maximum of 30 generations. The optimization runs slightly longer than forward selection or backward elimination. But the accuracy is clearly higher: 82.72% and with that the best result we have achieved. What is equally interesting is the subset of 11 attributes selected by the algorithm:  attribute_6 attribute_11 attribute_12 attribute_16 attribute_20 attribute_21 attribute_28 attribute_36 attribute_39 attribute_47 attribute_49 This subset covers all four important areas of the frequency spectrum. We have attributes around attribute 11, attribute 20, attribute 35, and attribute 45. Which is exactly the reason why this feature selection has outperformed the other approaches. The evolutionary algorithm was simply not running into local extrema and stopped too early. It kept going until it found a much better result.  Key Takeaway  Forget about forward selection and backward elimination. Evolutionary feature selection should be the technique used to solve this problem. In my next blog post I will discuss how we can get better results and additional insights by not only optimizing for the most accurate model alone. Instead, we will also optimize for the simplest model at the same time. This will be the topic for the next blog post though.  RapidMiner Processes  Make sure to have RapidMiner downloaded.

I established the neural network model and obtained the results through the simulation operator.I tried to adjust the value of each factor to be consistent, and observed the change of the predicted result by changing the value of one factor, for example, reducing the fourth factor from 5 to 4 to determine the change of the result. Is it reasonable to explain the importance of the factor in this way? Also, how are the simulated global weights calculated? Is there a better way?2. Can the operator feature weights be used to evaluate the importance or influence of factors on prediction labels? Or can only be used as a step of factor selection before model training.Thank you very much for reading my question patiently.

Before attempting any backward elimination or maybe even brute force methods I would like to identify the most useful variables to reduce computational time. The variables are both continuous measurements, categorical ordinals and nominals. My knowledge is limited, but I think it would probably be appropriate to use different methods of feature selection depending on the data type? What kind of operators would you use for each of the data types (Weight by information gain, Chi-Squared etc.)? Or should I contemplate a completely different approach of feature selection?",FALSE

A staggering proportion of companies  are failing to obtain meaningful ROI from their data science projects. A  failure rate of 85% was reported by a Gartner Inc. analyst back in  2017, 87% was reported by VentureBeat in 2019 and 85.4% was reported by  Forbes in 2020. Despite the breakthroughs in data science and machine  learning (ML), despite the development of several data management  softwares and despite hundreds of articles and videos online, why is it  that production-ready ML models are just not hitting the  mark?&#10;&#10;People often attribute this to a lack of  appropriate data science talent and disorganized data, however, my  business partner and co-founder, Nirman Dave, and I were discussing this  recently, and we believe there is something more intricate at play  here. There are three key factors that hinder ML models from being  production-ready:&#10;&#10;1. Volume: The rate at which raw data  is created&#10;&#10;2. Scrubbing: The ability to make an  ML-ready dataset from raw input&#10;&#10;3. Explainability: The  ability to explain how decisions are derived from complex ML models to  everyday non-technical business users&#10;&#10;Let’s start by  looking at volume, one of the first key bottlenecks in making  production-ready ML models. We know that the rate of data being  collected is growing exponentially. Given this increasing volume of  data, it becomes incredibly essential to deliver insights in real-time.  However, by the time insights are derived, there is already new raw data  that is collected, which may make existing insights obsolete.  &#10;MORE FOR YOU&#10;‘We Can Control Our Own Destiny’: John  Zimmer Shares Lyft’s Vision For The Company’s Future And $1 Trillion  Market Opportunity&#10;The LSE Alumni Turning Their University Into A  Startup Powerhouse&#10;Coinrule Bags Big-Name Investors For Its  Automated Crypto Trading Platform&#10;&#10;Additionally, this is  topped with data scrubbing, the process of organizing, cleaning and  manipulating data to make it ML-ready. Given that data is distributed  across multiple storage solutions in different formats (i.e.,  spreadsheets, databases, CRMs), this step can be herculean in nature to  execute. A change as small as a new column in a spreadsheet might  require changes in the entire pipeline to account for  it.&#10;&#10;Moreover, once the models are built, explainability  becomes a challenge. Nobody likes to take orders from a computer unless  they are well explained. This is why it becomes critical that analysts  can explain how models make decisions to their business users without  being sucked into the technical details. &#10;&#10;Solving even  one of these problems can take an army and many businesses don’t have a  data science team or cannot scale one. However, it doesn’t need to be  this way. Imagine if all these problems were solved by simply changing  the way ML models are chosen. This is what I call the Tiny Model Theory.  &#10;&#10;Tiny Model Theory is the idea that you don’t need to  use heavy-duty ML models to carry out simple repetitive everyday  business predictions. In fact, by using more lightweight models (e.g.,  random forests, logistic regression, etc.) you can cut down on the time  you’d need for the aforementioned bottlenecks, decreasing your time to  value.&#10;&#10;Often, it’s easy for engineers to pick  complicated deep neural networks to solve problems. However, in my  experience as a CTO at one of the leading AI startups in the Bay Area,  most problems don’t need complicated deep neural networks. They can do  very well with tiny models instead — unlocking speed, reducing  complexity and increasing explainability. &#10;&#10;Let’s start  with speed. Since a significant portion of the project timeline gets  consumed by data preprocessing, data scientists have less time to  experiment with different types of models. As a result, they’ll  gravitate toward large models with complex architecture, hoping they’ll  be the silver bullet to their problems. However, in most business use  cases — like predicting churn, forecasting revenue, predicting loan  defaults, etc. — they only end up increasing time to value, giving a  diminishing return on time invested versus  performance.&#10;&#10;I find that it's akin to using a  sledgehammer to crack a nut. However, this is exactly where tiny models  can shine. Tiny models, like logistic regression, can train concurrently  by making use of distributed ML that parallel trains models across  different cloud servers. Tiny models require significantly less  computational power to train and less storage space. This is due to the  lack of complexity in their architecture. This lack of complexity makes  them ideal candidates for distributed ML. Some of the top companies  prefer simple models for their distributed ML pipeline involving edge  devices, like IOTs and smartphones. Federated machine learning, which is  based on edge-distributed ML, is quickly becoming popular  today.&#10;&#10;An average data scientist can easily identify  how a simple model like a decision tree is making a prediction. A  trained decision tree can be plotted to represent how individual  features contribute to making a prediction. This makes simple models  more explainable. They can also use an ensemble of trained simple  models, which takes an average of their predictions. This ensemble is  more likely to be accurate than a single, complex model. Instead of  having all your eggs in one basket, using an ensemble of simple models  distributes the risk of having an ML model with bad performance.  &#10;&#10;Simple models are much easier to implement today since  they’re more accessible. Models like logistic regression and random  forests have existed for much longer than neural nets, so they’re better  understood today. Popular low-code ML libraries, like SciKit Learn,  also helped lower the barrier of entry into ML, allowing one to  instantiate ML models using one line of code.&#10;&#10;Given how  crucial AI is becoming in business strategy, the number of companies  experimenting with AI will only go up. However, if businesses want to  gain a tangible competitive edge over others, I believe that simple ML  models are the only way to go. This doesn't mean complex models like  neural nets will go away — they’ll still be used for niche projects like  face recognition and cancer detection — but all businesses require  decision-making, and simple models are a better choice than complex  ones.&#10;YEC&#10;YEC&#10;&#10;    Print&#10;     Reprints &amp; Permissions&#10;&#10;""""/>        <parameter key=""""add label""""

This is done to prevent information leakage through normalization.In SKlearn this can be done by fitting a scaler on the training set (scaler_A.fit(training_data)) and normalizing the test set using the same scaler (scaler_A.transform(test_data))How can this be achieved with the normalization block in RapidMiner?Thanks!",FALSE

Simply put, a large number of features makes it difficult for machine learning models to extract the underlying pattern I am searching for, and hence the performance of the models becomes worse. The solution to this problem is feature selection: choosing the features which contain information about the problem you are working on and removing the ones without any information.   RapidMiner provides you with some great out-of-the-box tools for feature selection, for example weighting algorithm operators such as Weight by Correlation or Weight by Information Gain. Advanced feature selection algorithm operators can also be used in RapidMiner such as Forward Selection and Backward Elimination. An extended overview about the possibilities of feature weighting in RapidMiner can be found in @mschmitz's excellent KB article: Feature Selection Part 1: Feature Weighting.   If you want to go into more detail and investigate the performance of feature selection itself, you may want to try out the dedicated Feature Selection Extension in the RapidMiner Marketplace. In this article I will showcase the usage of the extension and what you can do with it. The processes shown in this article are also attached, so feel free to test them on your own data set.   Note that """"attributes"""" are often called """"features"""" when discussing the topic of feature selection – they are the same thing. For this article I will use with the word """"feature"""" throughout. For more information (and more theoretical background) about feature selection and the Feature Selection Extension for RapidMiner, please have a look at Sangkyun Lee, Benjamin Schow, and Viswanath Sivakumar, Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data with RapidMiner, Technical Report SFB 876, TU Dortmund, 01/2011   Why Feature Selection?   There are four main reasons to apply feature selection on a machine learning problem: Less complex models which handle a smaller number of features are easier to interpret and in general more explanatory. Concentrating on the most relevant features enables data scientists to explain the decision making of the models to engineers, managers and users. A data set with a high number of features also needs a high number of examples to describe its statistic properties. In fact the needed number of examples to comprehensively describe the data set grows exponentially with the number of features. A larger number of features increases the runtime of both the training and the application of machine learning models. Removing unrelevant features speeds up the runtime of the machine learning algorithms. A large number of features often comes with a high variance in several of the features. This variance can decrease the stability and performance of the machine learning models trained on this data set.   Feature Selection Methods - Filter and Wrapper Methods   RapidMiner has several operators which can weight the features of your data set. Figure 1 gives a short overview. The weights can be used by the Select by Weights operator to reduce the number of features and only work on the most relevant ones, according to the used weighting method.   Figure 1: Overview over the Feature Weights operators in RapidMiner. Any method that selects features by weighting is called a """"filter method"""". It has the disadvantage that no feature interaction is taken into account. On the other hand so called """"wrapper methods"""" allow the algorithm to search through all possible subsets of features and select the best performing one. RapidMiner has several wrapper method operators for feature selection such as the Forward Selection and Backward Elimination. These two operators iteratively add or remove features to the subset and train a model with this subset. Model performance is used to determine the best performing feature subset. Note that wrapper methods are typically computationally expensive and have a risk of overfitting.   MRMR - Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance   The Feature Selection Extension of RapidMiner offers additional algorithms which bridge the gap between the simple filter and expensive wrapper methods. One example is the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance feature selection algorithm. Its basic idea is that features are iteratively added which are most relevant to the label, and have the least redundancy to previously selected features. The algorithm is implemented by the Select by MRMR / CFS operator in the Feature Selection Extension.   How many attributes to select?   It is crucial to balance the amount of selected features. Removing too many might result in a loss of information, but keeping too many might not result in the desired benefit. The right amount of reduction can be found by investigating the performance and the stability of the feature selection. Figure 2 shows a RapidMiner process in which the stability and the performance of a MRMR feature selection algorithm applied on the Sonar Sample data set is evaluated:   Figure 2: RapidMiner process to evaluate the stability and performance of the MRMR feature selection algorithm in dependency of the number of selected features The Loop operator loops over the number of selected features. In each of the 10 iterations, the Ensemble-FS operator is used on a different subset of the input data sample to evaluate the stability (also called robustness) of the feature selection. The 10 selected feature sets are then compared by calculating the so-called Jaccard-Index (here called robustness). This index describes how similar the different subsets are. A robustness value close to 1 indicates that the subsets do not differ much and the feature selection can be considered to be stable.   The features selected by the Ensemble-FS operator are then used to train a random forest model inside the Cross Validation operator. Thus for every group of selected features, we evaluate the corresponding performance of the random forest model. The results of this process are dependent on the robustness of the feature selection from the number of selected features (see Figure 3), and the performance of the feature selection from the number of selected features (see Figure 4):   Figure 3: Dependency of the robustness of the MRMR feature selection algorithm from the number of selected features. The robustness improves with the number of selected features. With 30 selected features it reaches a constant level. Figure 4: Dependency of the performance of the MRMR feature selection algorithm from the number of selected features. The performance improves with the number of selected features and stay on a constant level for 10 or more selected features. Figure 3 shows that the robustness improves when more features are selected. For 30 and more selected features, the robustness reaches a relatively constant level; hence the selection can be considered to be stable in the example for 30 or more features. The performance also increases with the number of selected features, but only when selecting fewer than 10; performance levels off when selecting 10 or more features. Hence in this example analysis of the Sonar Data Set, the number of selected features can be set to 30 to receive a stable feature selection with the highest possible performance.   Automatic Analysis of Feature Weights with RapidMiner   RapidMiner also offers the possibility to automatically analyze the feature weights for the different methods provided in RapidMiner. Figure 5 shows an example process how to do this (N.B. this process uses the Operator Toolbox Extension).       Figure 5: RapidMiner process to automatically analyze the feature weights for 8 different weighting methods The first Loop operator loops over the different weighting methods. For each method a second Loop performs 30 iterations of the same weighting. The results are appended and the 30 iterations are averaged by the Aggregate operator. Thus the final ExampleSet contains the average and the standard deviation of the weights for every feature and every method.   Inside the second Loop operator, a Sample (Bootstrapping) operator is used to sample a bootstrapped subset of the input data. The Select Subprocess operator is used to select the current weighting method for this iteration. The results for the feature weights for the MRMR feature selection algorithm are shown in Figure 6:   Figure 6: Averaged feature weights calculated by the MRMR feature selection algorithm This process shows another trick for investigating feature selection: using the Generate Attributes operator to generate a purely random feature in the input data. This random feature is also included in the weighting algorithm. All other features that receive a weight less than or equal to the random one are considered to provide equal or less information than a purely random feature. This can be used to define a threshold on the feature weights.   Conclusion   Feature selection is an important and advanced topic in a data science project. A good selection can largly improve the performance of your machine learning models and enable you to concentrate on the most relevant features. RapidMiner's  Feature Selection Extension enables you to perform advanced methods of feature selection and also dig deep into the stability and the performance of your feature selection processes. Feel free to test it and extract the best out of your data.   Author: @tftemme, January 2018",FALSE

This attribute performance can be a result by itself, because it can tell you what reasons make someone or something behave in this way. In this article we will discuss common techniques to find these feature weights. Filter Methods One of the most used methods to find an attribute importance is to use a statistical measure to define importance. Often used measures are Correlation, Gini Index or Information gain. In RapidMiner you can calculate these values using the Weight by Operators.       The resulting object is a weight vector. The weight vector is the central object for all feature weightening operations. If we have a look at it, it looks like this:    There are two operators which are important for the use of weight objects. Weights to Data converts this table into an example set. This can then be exported into Excel or a database. Select by Weights allows you to select attributes using this weights. You can for example select attributes only having higher weights than 0.1 or take the k top ones.   Including Non Linear Attributes and Combinations   The Filter methods above have the problem to not incorporate non-linearities. A technique to overcome this is to generate non-linear combinations of the same attribute. The operator Generate Function Set can be used to generate things like pow(Age,2) or sqrt(Age) and combination between these. This operator is usually combined with Rename by Construction to get readable names.   Handling Dependencies Another known issue with the filter methods are dependencies between the variables. If you data set contains Age, 2xAge,3xAge and 4xAge all of them might get a height feature weight. A technique which overcomes this issue would be MRMR. MRMR is included in RapidMiner's Feature Selection Extension.   Model Based Feature Weights   Another way to get feature weights is to use a model. Some models are able to provide a weight vector by themselves. These values are telling you how important an attribute was for the learner itself. The concrete calculation scheme is different for all learners. Weight vectors are provided by these opertors: Linear Regression Generalized Linear Model Gradient Boosted Tree Support Vector Machine (only with linear kernel) Logistic Regression  Logistic Regression (SVM) It is generally advisable to tune the parameters (and choice) of these operators for a maximal prediction accuracy before taking the weights.   A special case is the Random Forest operator. A Random Forest model can be feeded into a Weight By Tree Importance operator to get a feature weight.      Feature Selection Methods   Besides Feature Weighting you can also use a Feature Selection Techniques. The difference is, that you only get a weight vector with 1 if it in the set of chosen attributes and a 0 if it is not in. The most common techniques for this are also wrapper methods namely Forward Selection and Backwards Elemination.     Polynominal Classification Problems and Clustering In polynominal Classification problems it is often useful to do this in a one vs all fashion. This answers the question """"what makes group A different from all the other""""? A variation of this method includes to apply it on cluster labels to get cluster descriptions.   Evolutionary Feature Generation   Another sophisticated approach to incorporate non-linearities and also interaction terms (e.g. find a dependency like sqrt(age-weight)) is to use a evolutionary feature generation approach. The operators in RapidMiner are Yagga and Yagga2. Please have a look at the operator info for more details.   Prescriptive Analytics   Instead of generation a general feature weight you can also find individual dependencies for a single example. In this case you would vary the variables in an example and check the influence predicted by your model. A common use case is to check whether it's worth to call a customer or not by checking his individual scoring result with and without a call.     Resources Paper on Feature Selection Extension - http://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/PublicPublicationFiles/schowe_2011a.pdf",FALSE

"David_A","November 4, 2021 2:17AM","New OPC-UA Connection released","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/59074/new-opc-ua-connection-released","SummaryThe OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) is an extremely popular protocol for machine-to-machine communication. It connects industrial equipment and IoT (Internet of Things) devices with data collecting servers and can give deep insights about shop floor level data IoT devices can be connected to a variety of equipment types such as temperature and pressure sensors in a chemical plant tank and conveyor belt speed sensors in a packaging plant. The new RapidMiner OPC-UA Connector Extension, released at the same time as RapidMiner Studio version 9.10, allows analysts and data scientists to tap into this vast pool of industrial plant data. The extension provides capabilities to create and manage connections to an OPC-UA server, and new operators that aid engineers in discovering and integrating helpful data sources  into a RapidMiner process.Technical OverviewThe OPC-UA extension uses the open-source stack of the Eclipse Foundation project Milo to establish a connection to an OPC-UA server. The server endpoint URL is stored in a new connection object, and the connection can be tested to ensure that the server can establish connectivity with the local Studio client.The Browse Nodes operator crawls through all connected nodes on the server and returns a list of them, including their data types and, if selected, a sample value. There are a few things to consider:The node structure is quite complex; it has a hierarchical layout with multiple references to the same node.That is why on large servers crawling can take a long time and return duplicate entries.Not all nodes are human-interpretable, especially in namespace 0, and are meant for diagnostics and internal settings only.The Read OPC-UA operator connects to a specific node and collects new incoming data. It will request values at a specified time interval and duration. Note: the operator will wait until the duration is completed before returning any results. Hence, we recommend running this operator frequently with short durations (for example with an AI hub scheduler) rather than waiting a long time for one large result.The Read OPC-UA History operator allows users to retrieve stored historical events from a node. Given a specific time window, the operator will collect as many data points as specified. Note: OPC-UA reads data in reverse chronological order, so it goes from the Start Date ‘backwards’ until the End Date). If users are retrieving high frequency or slowly changing data, we recommend skipping some values, for example reading every other data point. To ensure you get all values for a specific period, simply supply a large enough number of data points since the operator will stop when there are no more data available.Note: not all nodes have the feature to store historic data, i.e. """"HistoryRead"""". If you try to read stored data from a node without this property, you will see an error message like this:Figure 1: Error message when trying to read historic data from a node that does not store data.Practical DemonstrationLet us look at a practical approach on how to work with the OPC-UA Connector.First, we create a connection to a publicly available demo server: opc.tcp://opcuademo.sterfive.com:26543 and then check if the connection can be established:Figure 2: Successful connection test to a public OPC-UA serverWe could choose to start scanning for all available nodes, but we take a shortcut and focus only on the node on production name space 1 with nodeID 1001. This is a demo asset of the server: a pressure tank with some sensors.The output of the Browse Nodes operator reading data from the node (ns=1,i=1184) node looks like this:Figure 3: Result of Browse Nodes, showing all sub-nodes that are linked to that asset.For us, the most interesting attribute is Pressure (ns=1;i=1185) which provides a numerical value of the current pressure in the tank. We now use the Read OPC-UA operator to start collecting new incoming sensor readings and use them right away in RapidMiner. We configure the operator to collect 20 measurements for a duration of 10 seconds:  Figure 4: Live data values of a pressure sensor. Now after some understanding of the data we decide to analyze more data points, but without waiting for new data. Using the Read OPC-UA History operator, we can collect stored data from past events. Again, not all servers and nodes support this feature, but in this example, the pressure node has historical data for the past several minutes (remember this is a public server storing events only for a short time; in live systems data can reach back months or years).We select the current time (while writing the post) as the start time, and the end time a few hours earlier. We also choose to retrieve only every 10th measurement which still gives us a 2-second time resolution:Figure 5: Collected historical data of the same pressure sensor for a longer period.With historical data we can now, for example, build an anomaly detection model to compare new events to these past data and see if they fall within an expected distribution. We train a univariate outlier detection model (from the Operator Toolbox extension [link]) and store the model in a RapidMiner repository for the next step, deployment, to see if new sensor values behave differently previously observed values.So now we collect new data within a short duration, say 10 seconds, and calculate their respective outlier scores:Figure 6: New collected live data, with an outlier scored, based on the model build on the historical data.We see the pressure values during this period are considered normal, but we could calculate a maximum outlier score and then monitor these scores in real-time, raising an alarm if a score goes above this threshold. To accomplish this, we could place the operators inside a loop and let the process run locally or use an AI Hub for a more scalable and reliable solution. We could schedule the scoring process to be run regularly or place it in a Real-Time Scoring Agent (RTSA) for low-latency, on-demand deployment.TerminologyOPC-UA ServerThe instance that is managing the OPC-UA infrastructure. It hosts all managing components and stores the data collected by associated assets. The exact architecture and available features can vary, especially with many commercial vendors selling their own proprietary versions.Endpoint URLURL pointing to a specific OPC-UA server. URLs typically start with """"opc.tcp://"""" as protocol followed by an IP or alias, plus port number and additional identifiers.Examples:    • opc.tcp://localhost:26543/UA/MyLittleServer    • opc.tcp://opcuademo.sterfive.com:26543Namespace IDTop Level ID of a server represented as an integerNamespace 0 is typically used for the system level of the server (status level, diagnostics, references), whereas levels 1, 2, ... are user defined name spaces for registering assets such as machines.Node IDThe Node ID is the unique identifier of an asset in a namespace.Node IDs can have the following types:NumericStringGUIDByte StringNumeric and string types are used most often.Node ID Naming SchemaThe common naming schema for Node IDs is the following:ns=0;i=1158 or ns=1;s=VesselPressureThe first part is the namespace address """"ns="""", followed by the integer value of the namespace. The second part is the Node ID with its type of prefix:i = numerics = stringg g= GUIDb = byte stringIn RapidMiner it is possible to either enter the namespace and node id as separate integer values or enter the full id directly as sting.",FALSE

The Process Testing extension streamlines testing RapidMiner processes for RapidMiner users and extension developers.  The Process Testing extension allows creating process-based unit tests. Processes may be run as tests which automatically saves the results of the process as expected results. Later, processes may be re-run again to automatically compare the then-created results with the previously created expected results. Tests are passed if the results are still the same or they fail if this is not the case.   Benefits and steps to implement process testing in RapidMiner:   Very powerful way to monitor the changes in the expected results of the process at each phase of end-to-end data science workflow. For example if the input data of a process from an external data source changes, the performance matrix of the training model may differ from the matrix of the previously trained model which is stored as the expected result (benchmark or reference matrix).   'Execute Process Tests' operator in this extension helps detect these changes and flags such process execution outcome as a failure. Further RapidMiner Server scheduling feature can help send automated email alerts to a system admin or process developer about the execution status.   Similarly, we could extend the same concept to detect changes in weights of attributes for a given ExampleSet, changes in scoring results, ETL, data cleansing, feature engineering, feature selection workflows, send alerts if the champion machine learning model changes, and so on.   How do I use it?       1) Download the extension in RapidMiner Studio from the Extension >> Marketplace and re-start RapidMiner Studio:Download the extension Once the Studio is re-started you will find a new menu option called Testing and 2 new operators in the Operator >> Extensions FolderTesting - menu option in StudioProcessing Testing operators            2) Select a RapidMiner process that you wish to perform the process testing on. Save the process in the Repository, navigate to Testing >> Run And Store As Expected Results. This runs the current process and stores all the output ports as expected results in the current repository location of the process.    Note: This is a very important and mandatory step in the Process testing framework since it creates the expected results of given process and is used as a reference to compare results when the same process is re-run again.    In the following example, I have created 001 sampling process to sample down the 'Titanic' data 100 sample or examples. When the Run And Store As Expected Results option is executed, the result of the process at the output port is stored in the repository as shown below:   Sampling down data and storing the expected results of the output of the process    3) Use the Execute process tests operator to test this process to check if there is any change in the output results.      (Save this process in the Repository as 'Execute Process')   Execute Process to test the process 001 sampling resultsIf there are no changes in the 01 sampling process the output will be same as the stored expected results '01 sampling-expected-port-0' and the test outcome will be success as shown below: 01 sample testing results   Now let's make some changes to the 01 sampling process and examine how Execute Process detects changes between the actual result of the process and the expected results of the process:   Change the sample size to 1000 and save the process  If we re-run Execute Process, the outcome is a failure since the expected result '01 sampling-expected-port-0' has 100 samples stored, but the updated 01 sampling process results in 1000 samples as shown below:   Outcome: Failure, with appropriate Error message Further, we can extend this process to Run Batch testing. 'Execute Process Tests' operator executes all processes under the selected repository location. The location can either be a single process, a folder, or a repository. Underlying folders are also executed recursively. The result contains the location, the outcome (success or failure) and the error message for each executed process. Processes, which contain the string literal """"NOTEST"""" in their name, are not executed. Batch testing of the processes    4) Schedule to run this process on the RapidMiner Server to send automatic email alters on the failure of any given process:   Send automatic email alerts when a process fails in Process testing Here is a sample alert email sent with the list of failed processes when the above process is triggered to execute as per the schedule:   Sample email alert    Note: To execute Process Testing on RapidMiner Server, make sure to install the extension jar in RapidMiner Server home directory and the job-agent you intend to run/schedule this process; To use the Send Mail operator, make sure to set up your email settings on Studio and Server accordingly.         Additional Feature:    Extension developers can test if the operator they have developed is user-friendly. The Process Testing extension has an operator named 'Expect User Error'. This operator is a nested operator i.e. it has a Subprocess.   This operator first tries to execute the Subprocess. If a UserError (defined by the i18n_key parameter: i18n_key maps to particular user error) occurs during the execution of the Subprocess, this operator runs successfully and writes a log entry. If there is no UserError, or if during the execution of the subprocess there is a UserError that is different from what was specified by the i18n_key parameter, the operator throws a UserError itself, which contains information about the reason of failure.     There is a sample tutorial process in the help section of this operator to demonstrate the functionality of the 'Expect User Error' operator:   Expect User Error  You can find all data and processes associated with this post in the Community Repository inside RapidMiner Studio.   Hope you find this article useful. Feel free to post comments, feedback, and questions about Process Testing.   Cheers,",FALSE

Helpful suggestions are appreciated.Overview This goal of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program is to help students learn the key skills they need to perform well as a machine learning engineer. A graduate of this program will be able to: • Test Python code and build a Python package of their own. • Build predictive models using a variety of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. • Use Amazon SageMaker to deploy machine learning models to production environments, such as a  web application or piece of hardware.. • A/B test two different deployed models and evaluate their performance. • Utilize an API to deploy a model to a website such that it responds to user input, dynamically. • Update a deployed model, in response to changes in the underlying data source. This program is comprised of 4 courses and 4 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the lessons. Your completed projects will become part of a career portfolio that will demonstrate to potential employers that you have skills in feature engineering, building machine learning algorithms, and model deployment.",FALSE

The Explain Predictions operator uses an algorithm by @IngoRM which is focused around best speed, understand-ability and application on a range of use cases as well as data types.The new operator adds the known algorithms of LIME, Shapely and SHAP to the mix. The operator Generate Interpretations has a very similar interface to the familiar Explain Predictions. In fact it also embeds Explain Predictions so that you can switch between different algorithms and get different ‘opinions’ on your predictions. Please be aware that this is a first alpha release of the extension. We are continuously working on improving it. We appreciate every feedback! Thanks!Philipp & Martin",FALSE

Some questions came up and I would be grateful if you could help me.In general I learned that FS methods can be sorted into """"filter"""", """"wrapper"""" and """"embedded"""" methods, so I tried something from each approach. My dataset consists of about 20 numeric attributes and 10.000 examples, with the goal of identifying the most relevant features for a numeric label.Filter ApproachI used the operators """"Weight by Correlation"""" and """"Weight by SVM"""", where I normalized the weights (Click on normalize weights"""" in the Parameters Panel) and can now compare the two weight directly, because I get values between 0 and 1. For example in Screenshot 1 are shown the results from """"Weight by SVM"""", Left normalized and right not normalized for a later comparison.Screenshot 1: Weight Results from """"Weight by SVM"""" (left WITH normalization, right WITHOUT normalization)Wrapper ApproachIn this context I used the """"Forward Selection"""", """"Backward Elimination"""" and the """"Optimize Selection (Evolutionary)"""" operator. Is it possible to get weights of the features between 0 AND 1, because currently only a 0 OR a 1 is output for the weighting? If I understood that correctly, it is not possible, because different subsets are tested and subset with the best performance is selected, right? (I have followed Inga Mierswa's Blog Posts when doing the wrapper approaches, see LINK)Embedded ApproachIn this context I used the weighting function of the models. For example, the """"SVM"""" operator or the """"Linear Regression"""" operator offers the possibility to output the weights. The first question: Is it correct that this weighting by these operators is a so-called embedded approach? Furthermore, I would like to compare the results of the weighting by the models with the weighting by the filter methods. The problem is that I have not yet found a way to normalize the model-based weightings in the same way as with the filter methods. In the filter methods I can click on """"normalize weight"""" in the parameter window. Unfortunately this is not the case with the models. I already tried to use the """"Weights to data"""" operator and then the """"normalize"""" operator (Screenshot 2) with method """"range transformation"""" and min 0 and max 1, but I don't get the right results (Screenshot 3). The weights that are not normalized are approximately the same (see screenshot 1 and 3 on the right), only the normalized weights are not (see screenshot 1 and 3 on the left). For example, the attribute 0.07_ below has a weight of 0 while above it has a weight of 0.539?Screenshot 2: Normalize the Weights of the model """"SVM""""Screenshot 3: Weight Results from """"Modell SVM"""" (left WITH normalization, right WITHOUT normalization) There are both 18 attributes only the presentation is slightly different, please do not be confused by the height of the two screenshots)My goal is actually to get weights of the features between 0 and 1 for all methods that I used, so that I can compare all methods concretely with each other.Thank you very much.Best regardsMoritz",FALSE

I have data of 1266 patients thereof 63 died. A first selection of my variables was obtained by automodel from rapidminer checking for quality of the columns for modelling.--> through its preprocessing 53 columns are left. The columns are binary, categorized or continous. Missingness was adressed either by categorization or Forest imputation so no missing values are anymore in the columns.(Another approach which didn't brought me good results was:I did a statistical univariant analysis with t-test, whitney U-test and odds ratios calculation and included significant variables but through the univariant selection I got poor results afterwards by modelling) So I switched to the automodel preselection and want to obtain as following feature selection.For the selection I was convinced to use backward selection. Moreover appealing seemed to me the combination with weight by correlation and random forest.So I thought I do something like this:Select the 53 columns, and multiply it 3 times1- upsample - weight by correlation - weights to Data - generate attribut2- upsample - random forest - weights to data - generate attribut3- upsample by Smote within Backward elimination operator on the  training side - performing naive bays and validating by crossvalidation.and then I stuck with the append operator. And I don't get a final selection only three times information about the different weights or a selection according the backward selection. Actually the backward selection takes for this number of columns a long time so could I make a senseful preselection only by random forest and weights to data maybe and then select only this attributes to do the backward selection.I am very unsure what is a way how to do it? It doesn't need to be fancy. A simple proper feature selection would make me happy and also if someone could give me an advice. I am not well established in modelling so I don't know on what I can rely.In total I have to say I am very unsure how to obtain a good feature selection. And as easy as possible won't be bad too as I am more from the medicine than from data science - even I like to go into it.BestNora",FALSE

A very commonly used and powerful solution for sentiment analysis is training a model based on historical information or training set and then building a predictive model using that. Historical information may be available if in the past certain content was manually coded into different sentiment values. If not one will have to do a preparation step where a good sample should be manually classified as positive or negative sentiment. This is a one time effort and having a good training set will lead to better models and better predictions.   Please use this example along with the provided sample process (Attached as a zip file with this article)   An example of training set we will use today is as seen below. (It is also attached in the zip file attached with this article)    The process to build a model using this would involve at least following operators Read Excel (To read the sample data) Nominal to text (To specify which column is a text column, since Rapidminer """"Process Documents..."""" Operators work only on text data Process Documents from Data (This is the meta process for most text processing capabilities) Tokenize (This will be used to tokenize the content into words, n grams etc as needed) The actual process will look like this for the processing of training text    Inside the """"Process  Documents from Data' operator we will have one step for the basic process, i.e Tokenize   We will later on work on improviing this sub process if needed. The output of """"Process Documents from Data"""" will be your tokenized exampleset as well as a wordlist.   Now we can build a cross validation step using our """"Tokenized example set"""". We will also need to add the """"Set Role"""" operator to specify our Label (i.e target) variable. The process should look something like this.    To know more about validation, please look at these links Inside the validation operator we can use any of the learners. For text mining use cases, Naive Bayes is many times good and fast. You can also try SVM or Neural Nets but that increases the computational  complexity of the solution.   The validation step provides the model as well as information of performance of the model. """"mod"""" provides the model and """"ave"""" provides the performance. In our case for the basic example when using Naive Bayes our accuracy confusion matrix looks like    When using SVM our confusion matrix looks like    We will explore in a later article on how to improve on text processing. But for now lets assume this a good model.   Now to use this predictive model we will basically do similar process on the actual data set and then apply the model on the tokenized dataset. One addtional step we need to do is, pass the wordlist from the training """"Process Document from Data"""" operator to the scoring """"Process Document from Data"""" You process will look something like this.  The output from the Apply model will have three special columns. as seen the screen shot below Prediction(Sentiment) - Actual class confidence(negative) confidence(positive)  You can then add additonal text processing operators as needed in your use case to improve on your model   A sample detailed """"Process Documents from data"""" with more pre processing will look something like below.

It provides two operators, which forecast the next steps of a time series. The extension is designed to remove the complexity and ensuring good practices in hyper parameter tuning and validation.  The operator “Forecast Univariate” allows you to use statistical methods like ARIMA, Holt-Winters and Functional Seasonal Decomposition forecasting with one simple operator. A standard analysis of a data set looks like this:       As you see we only provide the data set to be forecasted and all the rest is done in this operator. The operator provides three results.  The forecast of the next n rows:    The performance of the operation validated using Sliding Window Validation:    And the back tested data, so that you can easily compare label and forecast.   [    The same interface and results are returned by the new operator “Forecast (Multivariate)”. Contrary to the univariate case it can use additional attributes as depended variables. This allows you to use for example the diesel price to forecast the gas price and vice versa. All the complexity of Feature Aggregation, Optimization of Hyperparameters and Validation is wrapped into the operator. You can just use it out of the box!  Currently the operator uses Decision Trees and Linear Models to forecast the future. Other machine learning models are added shortly.     Custom Operators  This extension is based on the custom operators’ extension. Custom operators are operators which created by using other operators. You can easily turn any workflow into an operator and ship it to your colleagues. This also means you can investigate our new operators and see what we are doing!",FALSE

However, the time to enter the community is still relatively short and has always been a self-study phase. Thanks to Rapidminer staff, Allie's help, taught me how to post in the RM community. So yes, this is the first time I asked me in such a warm community. I have recently read a few blog posts, including four articles on multi-objective optimization feature selection and four articles on correct cross-validation (these blog posts are all from Mr. Ingo). I feel inspired. This is worth my further study. My current confusion is that in the fourth blog post on correct cross-validation (https://rapidminer.com/blog/learn-right-way-validate-models-part-4-accidental-contamination/), Ingo Mr. Ms. said that it is to avoid accidentally contaminating data through feature selection. As a result, Ingo conducted cross-validation outside, and internally also had a cross-validation. In the third multi-objective optimization feature selection blog (https://rapidminer.com/blog/multi-objective-optimization-feature-selection/), Ingo provided a process that directly selects evolutionary features and does not Perform cross-validation. I have been wondering whether it is necessary to conduct cross-validation on the outside in order to achieve the above mentioned correct cross-validation blog mentioned in the avoidance of feature selection to bring about data pollution.But in multi-objective optimization I do not know how to establish such a process. I want to ask1. Do you need to add the correct cross-validation step outside? If necessary, how to establish this process? I hope partners and experts help me establish such a correct process. (I have included processes provided by Mr Ingo's blog .It is multi-objective optimization feature selection, and the other is correct cross-validation to avoid  accidental contaminationdue to feature selection. How do I merge them?)  2. If there is no need to merge, I also want to listen to the reasons given by my partners and teachers.Sincerely thanks",FALSE

Question 2:  If this is useful behavior, what could I do to replicate it on the P50 with a better GPU?Question 3: If this is useful, why doesn't it work when the RM window is minimized?  I suspect this is caused by the NVidia driver seeing the RM process as a video game which wouldn't need GPU help when minimized.",FALSE

soil arent shown on the depth. e.g contents of soil in 3 m depths and make this data to predict contents of soil in 5m depthi tried using impute missing values operator to estimate those missing

But, I do not know how to do this using the dataset?  And whether I have to plot some kind of graph wherein I can do this?Furthermore, the annual difference can be either negative or positive. However, when I use the classification small-medium-large, I cannot define if it is a negative change or positive. How can I resolve this issue?

We also develop RapidMiner extensions, bringing a bunch of useful functions to RapidMiner! We thought you might be interested in learning about our extensions and how to use them, so we'll start here with a tutorial on using our WebAutomation extension, enabling you to easily parse JSON and integrate REST APIs.We hope this is useful to you, please feel free to ask any questions below or find us on Twitter! We'll upload more tutorials explaining other functionalities of our various extensions soon.The WebAutomation Extension by Old World ComputingThe extension splits the process of parsing JSON in two steps. In the  first step, the user applies special operators to define the format of  the JSON data. This definition can be saved as regular object in the  repository or generated on the fly. The second step is applying the  specifications to parse JSON in to one or more data sets. Several  operators exist for this: While reading data from a file or out of a  data set is possible, there is also a handy request operator, fetching  the data directly from a web service. Fed with the raw JSON data, all of  these operators unpack the object’s structure and create one or more  example sets to be used in further analysis.Defining a format to extract a simple table from JSON data So how exactly does it work? As an example, let’s say  you are provided with data about books in JSON format. The data comes from an internal database where  it is stored as a JSON string. {    """"books"""":[       {          """"title"""":""""Java ist auch eine Insel"""",          """"subtitle"""":""""Einführung, Ausbildung, Praxis"""",          """"authors"""":[             {                """"first name"""":""""Christian"""",                """"last name"""":""""Ullenboom""""             }          ],          """"language"""":""""German"""",          """"edition"""":""""13., aktualisierte und überarbeitete Auflage"""",          """"publication date"""":2018,          """"publishing company"""":""""Bonn Rheinwerk Verlag"""",          """"keywords"""":[             """"Java Standard Edition 8"""",             """"Java Standard Edition 9"""",             """"Programming""""          ]       },       {          """"title"""":""""The elements of statistical learning"""",          """"subtitle"""":""""data mining, inference, and prediction"""",          """"authors"""":[             {                """"first name"""":""""Trevor"""",                """"last name"""":""""Hastie""""             },             {                """"first name"""":""""Robert"""",                """"last name"""":""""Tibshirani""""             },             {                """"first name"""":""""Jerome"""",                """"last name"""":""""Friedman""""             }          ],          """"language"""":""""English"""",          """"edition"""":""""2. ed., corr. at 5. print."""",          """"publication date"""":2011,          """"publishing company"""":""""NY Springer"""",          """"keywords"""":[             """"Machine Learning"""",             """"Statistics""""          ]       },       {          """"title"""":""""Learning Spark"""",          """"subtitle"""":""""lightning-fast data analysis"""",          """"authors"""":[             {                """"first name"""":""""Holden"""",                """"last name"""":""""Karau""""             },             {                """"first name"""":""""Andy"""",                """"last name"""":""""Konwinski""""             },             {                """"last name"""":""""Wendell""""             },             {                """"first name"""":""""Matei"""",                """"last name"""":""""Zaharia""""             }          ],          """"language"""":""""English"""",          """"publication date"""":2015,          """"publishing company"""":""""Beijing [u.a.] O'Reilly"""",          """"keywords"""":[             """"Machine Learning"""",             """"Cluster"""",             """"Big Data""""          ]       }    ] } Looking at the JSON, you will see that there are  several relations within the data that cannot be expressed as a simple  table. For example, there can be various author objects per book. For  now however, we are only going to extract the tabular data, but the  extension can easily extract these relations as separate, relational  tables or denormalized with duplicated entries.  As can also be seen in the tree view to the right, the  extension uses operators with subprocesses to model the JSON’s  structure. There is an Array operator within the Process Object  operator, which in turn houses Extract Properties and Commit Row  operators. Together, these operators define the structure of how  data is extracted from the JSON file. Process Object and Process Array  will tell the parser to enter the object or the array. As the JSON  always starts with an object or an array, the outermost operator will  not contain any parameters. However, note that inside of this outer  operator, there can be further Process Array and Process Object  operators which will have parameters, mirroring the JSON structure. Let’s see how this looks for the inner Process Array operator:  Here, we enter the „books“ property and define it to  be an array of objects. Whatever happens now inside the Process Array  operator will react to the inner objects.  Taking a look at the inner process of Process Array,  we see two operators: Extract Properties and Commit Row. Both define  what is supposed to happen when the parser finds an object within the book  array of a given JSON. In short, this process defines that the parser  is supposed to extract some properties and store them as Attributes in  the resulting example set and then finish a row in the resulting example  set when the object is processed, meaning we can extract any  information from properties of the current object that have scalar  values like strings, numbers or booleans. Once we have done that, we can  commit the row, so that each object is represented by a row in the  resulting example set. In this case, the objects in books are provided with titles, subtitles, and more detailed information such as language or publication date.  To extract these properties, we configure the extract properties  parameter in the Extract Properties operator: under “property”, we set  the name of the property. In this case title, subtitle and so on. On the  right under “Attribute name and type” we can freely assign a name of an  attribute and its type. When the definition is used for parsing, the  result will contain this attribute and the information will be stored in  it.  Please note that the specification object needs to be  passed to the outputs of the Process Object and Process Array operators.  There is always one input and multiple outputs, but you at least have  to provide one output. You can get the final specification on the  outermost Process Object or Process Array operator. Use a parser specification to parse JSON data In the next paragraph, we will see how we can use the  specification created in the last paragraph to actually parse a JSON. We  will continue the scenario where we got the book data from a database  table. All we need to do now is to add a Process JSON from Data  operator, feed it with the data and the parser specification and tell it  which Attribute contains the JSON data.  The parser will then take the input specification(s) and generate one data set per specification.  You can use the same specification with the various  other parse operators. There’s one to parse JSON from files and file  objects, coming in very handy when used in connection with the  RapidMiner Scoring Agents or RapidMiner Server’s web services. You can  also use JSON delivered by a macro, which finds its application mainly  in the deployment as web service or in the web application building. And  last but not least, the integration with the new operators to interact  with RESTful web services allows to parse web service responses directly  without overhead.",FALSE

I took a Basketball data set from Kaggle to get into Rapid Miner. I have three data sets, one for the """"games_raw"""", one for the """"teams_raw"""" and one for the """"ranking_raw"""" of the teams. I would like to work with the games data set but there are some columns in the teams and ranking data set I would like to use for enrichment of the games data set (see """"games_adj"""" as target data set). I build up a process but it seems to clumsy. Do you have an idea how to build up the RM process a bit smarter and faster?Thank you in advance!RegardsMike",FALSE

One of the most amazing gadgets in the sewing world got introduced named as tracing wheel. This small tool was created in order to transfer the patterns from one fabric to another.Many people around you at the time of sewing fabric at agood sewing machine for beginners think that spikes of the tracing wheel are going to mess up the appearance of the fabric. I recommend everyone to use this tracing wheel once and it will make your pattern work much easier. Today in this blog I am going to tell you how to use the tracing wheel and why you should use it.For the Pattern Protection:In some cases, you can see how your vintage patterns are fading over time or you may think that nobody can actually make such things around you. Now the question is how you can make it safe from getting vanished and how you can use it further in the fabric? With the help of the tracing wheel, you can transfer the design of the pattern to the other fabric or paper.In some ways, if you are feeling like that pattern protection is important and someday you would like to copy the same pattern on the other fabric then go for the tracing wheel. Start tracing the whole pattern on the fabric and then transfer it to the paper. Keep that paper in your catalogs and after years you will be able to find the tracing pattern of the vintage fabric.Cutting Mat:As you know tracing wheel is quite spiky in nature and to protect you need to place the cutting mat first on the table. You don’t have to apply the tracing wheel directly on the fabric as it can damage the thread and appearance. You need to turn the fabric to the wrong side and the carbon side down. Now keep the tracing paper on the fabric and start using the wheel.If you have an old fabric that is about to tear apart then you don’t have to take any precautions as it will destroy. Focus on the pattern lines and trace accurately. It will help you in creating a new piece of the same pattern.Push with Pins:Using pins is just not about the sewing but it’s related to the tracing wheel as well. To make the work easy and to keep the focus on the pattern, keep the carbon on the fabric and then gently use the pins on the top. Push the pins gently into the fabric and make sure the paper has enough space to trace the lines. With the light, pressure starts pressing the wheel on the fabric.When you are pressing the tracing wheel against the fabric then make sure you are not putting too much pressure which can **** the table. I advise you to start using the tracing wheel first on some rough patterns. In this way, you will get a complete picture of how to use it in a delicate manner and how you can make it till the end.Align the Grainline:In the beginning, while you are about to sew the traced pattern on the best sewing machine for beginners, every sewer needs to take care of the alignment. If the alignment of the carbon and grainline is not up to the mark then at the time of sewing you will get an improper texture and the whole thing will turn out to be a big mess.When you are about to start the tracing, make sure that carbon is aligned with the grainline and save your work from any kind of mishap. You can also put some weights on the sides of the fabric to stick the carbon and to get a clear view of the whole work. Choose the kind of carbon paper through which you can witness the lines of the fabric. You can also watch this video on thebest starter sewing machine for guidance on how to find the best sewing machine for beginners.Use the Stationary:When you are tracing something on the fabric and once you have fine lines around the garment, now the next thing you can do to make it permanent is to use the chalk or ink over it. I did this once when I wanted to save the pattern of my grandmother’s gown and that’s what I did to the pattern. That pattern is still in my old home totally saved.I made an outfit out of that pattern and it feels special to sew something out of the extraordinary. In the same way when you are tracing the pattern from some vintage fabric to the carbon or when you are transferring the pattern to some other fabric and you are scared that soon it will be vanished then use some stationary over it. This stationery will help you in keeping the pattern alive for the longest time.I don’t recommend the permanent ink but I would like to advise using the chalk or some pen so you can also check the original traced lines of the pattern.Conclusion:Tracing patterns is going to help you a lot in creating lots of old patterns with new fabric and it will make the process much easier. You can impress the people around you by recreating the whole pattern of the vintage garment. It will be much easier for you to create the bags or home décor items in the same pattern as they don’t need any kind of fittings like a garment.For any kind of stitching, the sewing machine must be good enough as well as cleaned.

Even as a beginner it’s important to always read something new and keep moving forward.",FALSE

I’m very new to this but am trying to learn!i created a csv with around 20 variables (columns) which should explain / predict one variable (column).After using the automodel function, which btw is a blessing, i chose the „predict“ function and selected the variable which i want to predict / explain with the others. Doing this gave me 3 questions, which after researching the internet i still cant answer:1. The variable which i want to have explained is a numerical one. When setting everything up, the tool asks me if I want to turn it into classification (after i already selected the prediction function). What does that mean and what would be my benefits if doing so ?2. When calculating, do the tools use all variables to explain/predict, or do the tools filter out the most efficient ones to do the calculation ? Because I was hoping to also get insight on which variables are the most important for the prediction instead of forcing the tools to use all of them...3. Some of the values have more decimal places than RapidMiner shows. The values therefore show as “0”... Is there a possibility to change the amount of decimal places?Thank you so much for the help...Greetings from Germany.",FALSE

Downloaded RapidMiner Free Studio (my understanding is it comes with one month of studio Enterprise) and signed up for RapidMiner GO on Saturday (April 3rd). Watched all the Academy videos (if you are going to send me there ). Started playing around and I got to several problems. DIsclaimer - At the moment I am evaluating head-to-head performance of RapidMiner, Weka and Orange. Weka and Orange are free, RM Go cost at 10$ a month is comparable. My understanding is that if file <50MB, <500 attributes file should be good to go on RapidMiner Go. So, I have a file of size <50MB, 11 attributes and 542 919 rows. No missing data in the dataset - not a single one. I 've run a classification on it, but unfortunately, it got truncated down to 120 000 rows. I have not gotten any notification in between.I also did some predictive modeling and I get a lot of MISSING data (especially obvious when I predict on a testing set). So far - this was GO. For the first month of Free RM Studio, I get Enterprise Studio where there is no limit on anything ( in theory). My computer has 16GB of RAM (if somebody is to ask - not bad, not great either).When I execute the same Modeling with AutoModel in Studio (I have Free Educational License with would come with a month of Enterprise Studio) I get even more truncated results - It all stops at 100 000 rows. Even worse - there is not a single missing point in the dataset, but there are missing in the prediction. So, my questions are: is the data truncated in Go? Is data truncated in Studio? Why Missing Values if there is not a single missing or NA cell in the dataset? How can I overcome this if I am to use RM in the future?Thank you so much, Radostina",FALSE

I have listed below all the details I have in mind and would appreciate if some of you experienced RapidMiners out there can guide me in building this.Background:I have 11 features in my dataset that will be used to construct a forecast value for the next day of the target variable (target variable is temperature in this case). I have 15 years of daily data where each day records the temperature of that day and the 11 features (in one row). So, I have a total of about 5,475 observations (i.e.: 15 years * 365 days).I know how I want the model to work but I am not really sure if this can be built on RapidMiner. The thought flow works as follows:  For each day in the dataset, I want to find and collect the 50 most similar days for the 11 features in the dataset. (I assume I would need a kNN algo here or maybe cross distances or data-to-similarity operator?).In the 50 most similar dataset, I want to then see what the temperature observed was on the NEXT day for these 50 days and compute the average temperature of the NEXT day for all of these 50 days.

Now I am not sure how to make a dependent or """"Label"""" variable that maps the economic viability of the property to use for modelling.I considered making an IF-THEN function :if(listed_year == """"Old"""" && overall_satisfaction<3 && reviews<5,""""Not Viable"""",if(listed_year == """"Old"""" && overall_satisfaction>=3 && reviews>=5,""""Viable"""",if(listed_year == """"New"""" && overall_satisfaction<3 && reviews<3,""""Not Viable"""",if(listed_year == """"New"""" && overall_satisfaction>=3 && reviews>=3,""""Viable"""",""""Not Viable""""))))In which basically what I tried to do as an example was that if a property is Old, has a satisfaction rating below 3 and reviews less than 5 made it not viable.Sadly, what it does is churns out a model with 99% accuracy and 1 Kappa and 0.99 AUC which is sorta not possible and indicates the model is overfitting to the data pool.I would love some inputs on how to tackle this.

My first project is to use Rapid Miner to predict whether a given person will donate to a certain NGO. The professor gave us a sample data set with over 20k entries and a data set to use for the prediction. He gave us a couple instruction but said nothing much so were basically on our own. The objective is for us to try different prediction algorithms and then tell him which one we feel performs the best for that specific data set. We found out 90% of our time would be spent cleansing the data since it had a lot of inconsistencies. That wasn't a fun task. Now we feel like we have the data clean enough for our purpose but we're still lost, we don't know what criteria to use when we clean the data other than when the numbers are in the wrong format or there's irrelevant text on a certain field. Anyway, we found out a couple algorithms that would fit our plan quite well like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Fortest and Deep Learning and also that we could compare them using the Compare ROCs operator and analyze the ROC curve afterwards. Doing that, we figured out Decision Tree was probably the best one because of what we read about how to interpret ROC curves. We also began experimenting with the Performance operator and got a 95% performance out of the Decision Tree but we'd love to compare them all at the same time. My idea was the following: maybe I could use the ROCs operator that allows multiple prediction operators inside and apply them all the Performance operator at the same time so we could have the results all at once but I haven't quite figured out how. Is there any way to do what I want to do? Sorry for the long essay",FALSE

"MartinLiebig","March 16, 2021 3:50AM","A Practical Guide to Gradient Boosted Trees - Part I, Regression","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/36379/a-practical-guide-to-gradient-boosted-trees-part-i-regression","Gradient Boosted Trees are one of the most powerful algorithms for classification and regression. They have all advantages of trees including the strength of handling nominal data well. The downside of any powerful, multivariate method is its complexity. This is the first of a series of articles drilling down into the algorithms and explain how they work.   The Setting In this tutorial we will investigate how a Gradient Boosted Tree is doing a regression. As training data we use a sqrt-function between 0 and 1.     To make our algorithm easier more graspable we use a few simplifications. We do a regression for a label variable (y) with only one dependet variable (x). We do use a GBT with a depth of 1 and learning rate of 1. We will discuss these options in later articles in more depth.   Initialization   Before starting with the real algorithm we will set a base line prediction. Our whole algorithm will consist of a lot of steps. The resulting function f(x) which will approximate the sqrt-function is a sum of the results of the individual steps. The first step is slightly different. We do set the base line prediction f0 to the average label. In our data this is 0.667.    Now we can move to the first iteration.   Step 1 - Calculate Errors   As a first step we calculate the errors. In our case these are the residuals between or our previous prediction f(x) and the truth y. In our fist iteration we do have f(x) = f0 = 0.667. We define r = y - f(x) as the error for each individual example. It is crucial to note that the tree in each iteration is not predicting the label, but r! Since this is only a change in scale our sqrt-function still looks like this: Step 2 - Tree Building We now built a regression tree predicting r. Since we limit our tree to a depth of one we get:      This tree results in two leafs. We call this leafs R11 and R12 representing the first and the second leaf in the first iteration. For each of the two leafs we need to find the best prediction.   Step 3 - Prediction Definition In our regression problem the calculation of what we predict in the leafs is fairly straight forward. We want to find the prediction, which minimizes the difference between our function and the truth. In our case this is the average of r in each leaf. We define the prediction in the i-th iteration and the j-th leaf as gij and get for our data:   g11 = -0.254 g12 = +0.157     Step 4 - Update of our Function    We can now update our approximated function to estimate y, called f(x). Let's define the result of our first iteration f1: f1 = -0.254 if x < 0.382, else: +0.152 And f(x) = f0 + f1. This results in a total function which approximates our initial unscaled sqrt like this: Step 1 - Part 2, Build residuals again We can now do Step 1 again. But this time we build the residuals between our new function approximation f(x) = f1 + f2 and y. So we get a picture like this:   In this iteration of the algorithm we try to fit this functions of residuals to get a better overall function approximation. Step 2  and 3- Part 2, Build the tree and calculate a prediction. Again we built a tree which splits up our data into to parts. If you look at the picture above, we do search for the point on the x-axis, where we can draw two lines parallel to the a-axis, which have a minimum distance to the residuals. The tree is telling us, that the splitting point is performed at 0.107 and the two parallel lines g21 and g22 are -0.193 and +0.023.  Step 4 - Updating the function The last step is to update our function. It is now: f(x) = f0 + f1+f2 or in full words: f1 = 0.667  -0.254+ if x < 0.382 +0.152 if x >= 0.382 - 0.193 if x < 0.107 + 0.023 if x >= 0.107    Or in a drawn form it looks like this:    Please be aware that the second tree is also raising the right hand side of the function by a little bit.   With this knowledge we can now move on and start with Step 1 again. That's it.           Naming y is the value of the label. E.g. the true value you want to predict x is the dependent variable. E.g. one (or many) regular attributes f(x) is the derived formula to predict y. E.g. the model Rij is the j-th leaf in the i-th iteration of the algorithm.  gij the constant added to our function for all examples who are in the i-th iteration and the j-th leaf. Note: Often called gamma in literature.",FALSE

"BalazsBarany","March 9, 2021 7:12AM","Tutorial for Creating Custom Operators","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/56872/tutorial-for-creating-custom-operators","This is a tutorial for creating a custom operator from a process, and putting it into a new extension.Make sure that you have the Custom Operators extension installed from the Marketplace, and that you're working with a Java Development Kit (JDK), not just a Java Runtime Engine (JRE). The JRE doesn't contain the necessary tools.The operator will optimize a Decision Tree automatically and return the optimized decision tree as a model, and its validation results.Create a folder structure in the repository to store the new extension and the operator processes.The first operator will be called “Optimized Decision Tree”. Save a new process under this name in the extension subfolder. (The folder names are arbitrary, this is how I structured my extensions.)Let's work with a sample example set as the input of the process (activate the Context panel if you didn't yet in the View/Show Panel menu). (We will remove this later, but we need data to test the process.) We're going with Iris here (very creative, I know).This is how the process looks like. Note that the input connector is “filled” because of the specified data input in the process context. The model output of Optimize Parameters is the first output of the process.Inside Optimize Parameters there is a Cross Validation with a Decision Tree.Then we set up Optimize Parameters with some parameter combinations. This will try a lot of combinations, so it will be slow on large datasets. (1,728 combinations * 11 models (because of 10-fold cross validation) take a while.)Feel free to try on a different dataset and possibly reduce the number of combinations to test.Test the process and make sure that it works as expected. It should also work when changing Iris to Labor Negotiations and Sonar in the process context. Thorough testing is important!After testing the process it's time to create a new custom operator. For this, remove the test input in the process context!Create a new folder on the hard disk (not in a RapidMiner repository!). This folder will contain all operators that go into the new extension. Inside this folder I recommend to save a file inputs.txt (the name is arbitrary) to record the inputs for the Custom Operator window. You don't want to type the entire description again every time you save a new version of the operator process!Now select File / Create Custom Operator. (If you don't have this menu entry, check if the Custom Operators extension is properly installed.)Enter the data into the appropriate text boxes. Here we select two exposed parameters, log_all_criteria from Optimize Parameters and number_of_folds from Cross Validation. When the form is set up, click Save and select the folder on the hard disk to put the custom operator file into.Create the extension by clicking Extensions / Create Custom Extension.Make sure to select the correct folder where you saved the custom operator. You can also select a color for your extension, it will apply to every operator in this extension. It's a good idea to activate Force dependencies if you want to share your extension with others.You only need the Jars folder if your extension uses external software libraries that should be included in the extension. This is normally not the case.Click OK. Now RapidMiner will work for a while and then ask if you want to restart with the new extension. After the restart, you see the new extension:It has the icon that was specified when creating the custom operator. The operator offers the selected parameters:It's a good idea to create a test process with the operator and apply it to multiple example sets.There is a surprise when executing the process with the custom operator: When we developed the original process, the log table from the parameter optimization was visible. Now it's not. It seems that the Custom Operators extension doesn't expose the process logs. This also means that the parameter “log all criteria” doesn't do anything. So we'll remove that parameter the next time we're creating the custom operator.Now we have seen that the operator takes a lot of time on medium or large size datasets, so we'd like to create an option to make it faster by reducing the number of parameter combinations.First we add a Category Parameter Macro operator from the Custom Operators extension and define the choices “fast” and “slow” there. We name the macro “speed”.We also need to expose the parameter number_of_folds as before. However, we have two cross validations here, so we want to set a macro to configure both from one source. So we use Set Macro as a simple parameter input.We create a branch to execute the optimization depending on the speed macro value.The Fast optimization operator is set up with a reduced number of combinations, so it might not find the best option like the slow one, but it will be much faster.The cross validations inside the parameter optimizations now use to the %{folds} macro.So this is how the new parameters are set up:Save the custom operator in the same folder as before, and recreate the extension with the same settings as before.When you create a new version of your extension, make sure to enter the same or a higher version number as before. RapidMiner will load the latest version of an extension, and that is what you want to work with.Testing the new process shows the updated operator parameters:Congratulations! You've learned how to create a custom operator from a RapidMiner process.",FALSE

The research firm's low-code market forecast suggests that a surge in remote development during the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to prop up the space overall, as more companies turn to low-code platforms to support innovation and digital transformation agendas. Low-code development enables enterprises to rapidly build and deploy software applications without the use of a professional programmer. Instead of writing every single line of code for a given application, users of a low-code or no-code platform can build their project with point-and-click interfaces. Gartner posits that low-code has become a general social and technological movement, bolstered by the emergence of citizen developers outside of IT, that will continue to grow significantly for years to come. Low-code application platforms (LCAP) are expected to be the largest contributor to the growth of the low-code development technology market through 2022, increasing nearly 30% from 2020 to reach $5.8 billion in 2021, according to Gartner. Gartner also points to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and hyperautomation as drivers of low-code adoption. Most of the major SaaS players have started to incorporate low-code development technologies in their repertoire of services. As SaaS grows in popularity, the low-code market will see commensurate growth in LCAPs and process automation tooling, Gartner said.The rise in low-code has also prompted changes to the makeup of traditional IT buyers. Gartner research found that, on average, 41% of employees outside of IT customize or build data or technology solutions. The research firm predicts that half of all new low-code clients will come from business buyers that are outside the IT organization by year-end 2025.""""The economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have validated the low-code value proposition,"""" said Fabrizio Biscotti, research vice president at Gartner. """"Low-code capabilities that support remote work function, such as digital forms and workflow automation, will be offered with more elastic pricing since they will be required to keep the lights running. Globally, most large organizations will have adopted multiple low-code tools in some form by year-end 2021. In the longer term, as companies embrace the tenets of a composable enterprise, they will turn to low-code technologies that support application innovation and integration.""""",FALSE

Estoy intentando realizar un clusterizado usando dbscan. Actalmente consigo el clusterizado que quiero dando un mayor o menos peso manualmente a mis features. Pero me gustaría conocer algun operador que haga esta funcion automáticamente. Esto, es, que en funcion de los datos introducids se autoajuste el peso que deben tomar cada una de las features.Muestro el pequeño proceso que tengo montado ahora mismo.En este caso trato señales de un emisor.Tengo 6 parámetros. RF_min, RF_max, pRI_max, pRI_min, PW_max, PW_min. Seria modificar el tipo de clusterizado que hace en función de los dispersos que estan los datos introducidos. Con esto em refiero por ejemplo, si hya valores con RF min en torno a 1000 y otros con 8000, el peso de RF se debe ver reducido. Sin embargo, si todos los valores están entre 5000 y 6000, pues que le dé mas peso, para que el clusterizado sea más idóneo.Cuando hablo de pesos, hablo de modificar el siguiente operador generateAttributes.En cuanto a los valores de dbscan, he probado a tocar el min points o el epsilon, pero no me gusta el clusterizado que hace. Por lo tanto ahora mismo esos dos valores los tengo fijados en, epsilon 0.2 y min points 1Pongo un ejemplo de lo que sucede. En este caso, PW por ejemplo no deberia tener variaciones y debería tomar 6.84 y 7 en el mismo cluster y no separarlo. Pero esto sucede porque RF debería """"tener menos peso"""" (dividir entre un número mayor), para disgregarlo menos y tener menos clusters.Y bien realizado sería mover el peso de RF a menos. Esto lo hago dividiendo entre 1000 y volviendo a correr el programa. Con esto consigo que todos los clusters se encuentren con Rf entre 9464 y 9871, sin realizar clusters nuevos entre estos dos valores.Asi bien, diviendo RF entre 1000 tengo:",FALSE

I am trying to do a clustering using dbscan. Currently I get the clustering I want by manually giving more or less weight to my features. But I would like to know some operator that automatically does this function. Depending on the input data, the weight that each of the parameters should take is self-adjusted.I show the small process that I have set up right now.In this case I deal with signals from a transmitter. I have 6 parameters. RF_min, Rf_max, PRI_max, PRI_min, PW_max, PW_min. I would like to modify the type of clustering it does depending on the dispersion of the entered data. By this I mean, for example, if there are values with RFmin around 1000 and others with 8000, it should not give so much weight to RF. However, if all the values are between 5000 and 6000, it should give more weight, so that the clustering is more suitable.This is how I choose the weights in the generateAttributes operator:Regarding the dbscan values, I have tried adjusting the min points, or the epsilon, but I don't like the clustering it produces. So right now I have min points:1, epsilon 0.2.I show an example of what happens. In this case, PW for example should not have variations and should take 6.84 and 7 in the same cluster and not separate it. But this happens because RF should have less weight to disaggregate it less.Properly done would be to move the weights of RF, to give less importance to this, and so that it does not create new clusters due to that small variation of RF. In this case, it should take as RF is always between 9464 and 9871, without making new clusters between these values. So I de-weight RF, dividing it now by 1000, and I get this.Thanks for your help",FALSE

I loaded both documents into RapidMiner, processed the document using Binary Term Occurrences, and then looked at the document similarity score (using Numerical Measures and CosineSimilarity) of .590. I interpreted this as meaning the documents have a similarity of 59%. To double check this I counted all the words (tokenized, change case, English stop words) that appeared twice or more. This totalled 64. The total number of attributes after processing the document is 157. Dividing 64 by 157 is .407 or 41%. The words that appeared only in one of the two documents totalled 93 or (157/93) .592 or 59%.

It copies files from a local repository to a server repository. This worked fine as long as I was the only user who did these deployments, but once other users started taking this responsibility, we found that keeping permissions up to date for all files was a major struggle. When a file is copied to the server, by default it is accessible only to the user who copied the file. So we need to manually login the server web interface, and recursively set permissions again on multiple folders (in studio, as far as I know there is no way to recursively set permissions). Otherwise, the deployment process will fail if the deployment was last performed by another user, because the files would only be writable by the user who did the previous deployment.We would need an operator to update permissions on a repository entry or folder, and ideally with an option to do it recursively (but in the worst case we can do it on individual entries by listing and looping through them). We would use this to assign rights to a group instead of individual users.I guess the """"best"""" recommendation would be for us to migrate to a Git-based server repository and use that to manage our deployments, but this requires a Docker-based RapidMiner Server installation and we are using a Windows server, so we can't do that for now.Thanks",FALSE

The challenge I'm having is how do I use this to show the predicted trend on the horizon? ie. The model tells me the prediction against known actuals but how do I translate that to t+1, t+2,t+3 etc view? In my example this would be Jan 15th, Jan 22nd etc etcI'm sure I'm missing something basic here so apologies if this is a no brainer question. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Cheers,Tim",FALSE

The """"Fantasy Football"""" challenge was fun but up here in Vermont, we are all hockey.  Plus the Winter Olympics are around the corner in Pyeongchang so perhaps more of you will be interested...   Part 1 of this is just getting the data. So the """"National Hockey League"""" (yes it's both Canada and the USA but it's still the """"National"""" Hockey League - don't get political on me) here in North America has a new API available to the public where you can download virtually everything about every game - including each play! It's pretty crazy.  And what's even crazier is that it's the only API I have seen where there is zero, yes zero, official documentation on this from the NHL.  Strange but true.  So there is a small group of dedicated data scientists who have been trying to reverse-engineer the API to get the endpoints and have been reasonably successful.  Most of the work is from Kevin Sidwar (see his excellent website here) plus some random R and Python code on GitHub.   So first I'd like to expand on Kevin's work by listing the root URL, all known endpoints, and some sample calls/responses.   Root URL: https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/   Endpoints:   /teams /teams/[team id] /teams/[team id]/roster   /people/[people id]   /divisions /divisions/[division id]   /conferences /conferences/[conference id]   /franchises /franchises/[franchise id]   /venues/[venue id]   /standings   /schedule   And the most important ones:   /game/[game id]/content /game/[game id]/feed/live   Yes that's right - LIVE FEED.  And not only play-by-play, but X and Y coordinate of where the player is on the ice when the play is made.  It's really cool.  For example take this game on Oct 4 with the Toronto Maple Leafs vs the Winnipeg Jets. First goal of the game was scored by Nazem Kadri in the 1st period.  OK fine - that's a box score.  But he hit that wrist shot exactly 84 feet from the center of the ice (at coordinates -84, 6 to be exact) which is right next to the goal. Pretty cool.  Here's the JSON snippet:   """"result"""" : {          """"event"""" : """"Goal"""",          """"eventCode"""" : """"WPG212"""",          """"eventTypeId"""" : """"GOAL"""",          """"description"""" : """"Nazem Kadri (1) Wrist Shot, assists: James van Riemsdyk (1), Tyler Bozak (1)"""",          """"secondaryType"""" : """"Wrist Shot"""",          """"strength"""" : {            """"code"""" : """"PPG"""",            """"name"""" : """"Power Play""""          },          """"gameWinningGoal"""" : false,          """"emptyNet"""" : false        },        """"about"""" : {          """"eventIdx"""" : 93,          """"eventId"""" : 212,          """"period"""" : 1,          """"periodType"""" : """"REGULAR"""",          """"ordinalNum"""" : """"1st"""",          """"periodTime"""" : """"15:45"""",          """"periodTimeRemaining"""" : """"04:15"""",          """"dateTime"""" : """"2017-10-04T23:47:47Z"""",          """"goals"""" : {            """"away"""" : 1,            """"home"""" : 0          }        },        """"coordinates"""" : {          """"x"""" : 84.0,          """"y"""" : -6.0        },        """"team"""" : {          """"id"""" : 10,          """"name"""" : """"Toronto Maple Leafs"""",          """"link"""" : """"/api/v1/teams/10"""",          """"triCode"""" : """"TOR""""        }      }   [Just in case you want to figure this out, the coordinates (0,0) represent the dead center of the ice.

Note that a hockey ice rink is a rounded rectangle; the coordinates (100, 42.5) do not exist. By my research the goal lines should be 11 feet from the ends of each side of the ice, which would be centered at (89,0) and (-89,0), but when I look at coordinates of goals scored right at the goal line, they appear to be more like (84,0).]      I am attaching a sample JSON file for each endpoint to this post, and of course a few RapidMiner processes to get the data in a nice format.   Until next time...   Scott",FALSE

More info here: https://www.rosette.com/   Get up and running with Rosette for RapidMiner Studio with this quick start guide, which covers the installation and setup process. We also demonstrate how to get started extracting and linking entities with Rosette. Installing RapidMiner and Rosette If you aren’t already running RapidMiner Studio, download the application on RapidMiner’s website, to download the Rosette Text Toolkit extension, open RapidMiner Studio, navigate to the Extensions menu and select Marketplace.      A new window will open. Search for “rosette” and select Rosette Text Toolkit from the list of results. Click the Install 1 Packages button at the bottom of the window and follow the click-through instructions to complete the installation.      Once the extension has finished installing, the Rosette operators will be visible in the Extensions folder of the Operators panel.    Getting a Rosette API Key In order to activate the Rosette Text Toolkit for RapidMiner Studio, you’ll need an API key and a Rosette developer account. Head over to developer.rosette.com and complete the signup process.  You can create an account linked to either your email or your GitHub account. No credit card is required — our default plan gives you 10,000 calls a day for free! If you’re interested in upping your call quota, check out our paid plans.      Once you have completed the signup process and verified your account, click on the API Key tab on the top left of the menu bar to display your key.    Setting up your Rosette API Connection Back in RapidMiner Studio, input your Rosette API key to start using any of Rosette’s operators. We’ll be looking at the entity extraction operator in the next section, so we’ll use it to set up the Rosette API connection now. First, locate Extract Entities in the Rosette Text Toolkit folder in the Operators panel and drag it to the Process panel.      You can see the various settings options for the Extract Entities operator in the The Parameters panel to the right of the Process panel. The first parameter is Connection. Click the Rosette icon to the right of the box.      The Manage Connections window will open. Click the Add Connection button on the bottom left and select Rosette Connection from the Connection type dropdown list. Name your new connection and click the Create button.      Select your new Rosette API connection from the list on the left and enter your Rosette API key in the API KEY box. Use the Test button at the bottom of the window to verify that your connection is working. If you run into any trouble, confirm that you have copied your API key correctly. When you are satisfied that everything is running smoothly, click the Save all changes button to return to the Parameters panel.      Select your new connection from the Connection dropdown list.    Extracting Entities Now that you’ve installed the Rosette for RapidMiner extension and set up your API key and connection, you’re almost ready to start analyzing. Last step: download RapidMiner’s Text Processing extension in the RapidMiner Marketplace, a helpful set of operators that allow you to load, filter, and analyze text from a variety of different sources. With that installed, head to RapidMiner Studio where we’ll use three operators to create a simple entity extraction workflow, or process: Create Document and Documents to Data from Text Processing, and Extract Entities from Rosette. Drag these operators into the Process panel and connect them together, maintaining the order listed above. You can find the operators using the Operators Search Bar.   Select the Create Document operator. In the parameter panel, check the add label box. Under label type, select text and enter ‘my_text’ for label value. Click the Edit Text button at the top of the panel and copy the text below into the popup window.   “Bill Murray will appear in new Ghostbusters film: Dr. Peter Venkman was spotted filming a cameo in Boston this… http://dlvr.it/BnsFfS.” Hit the Apply Changes button to save your work.      Now select the Documents to Data operator. In the Parameters panel, enter ‘my_text’ in the text attribute field.  Execute the process using the blue “play” button. The results show five extracted entities. As you can see, Rosette correctly extracted both the names and the location included in the text.      Let’s make our input text a little longer. Add the sentence below to the parameter text and rerun the process.   “Another original Ghostbuster, Dan Akroyd, is also confirmed to have a cameo in the film.”  From the results we can see that Rosette extracts Dan Akroyd’s name as expected. However, eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that “Akroyd” is misspelled. (It should be “Aykroyd.”) This is not uncommon. Name misspellings appear frequently, everywhere from personal blogs to the New York Times online. If you are trying to track a particular entity across a large collection of documents, you want to make sure that you are identifying all possible spellings of that entity’s name. Rosette automatically extracts and links entities with spelling variations and other textual anomalies, unifying them into a single entry.      To demonstrate this functionality, let’s enable Link Entities in the Extract Entities parameter panel.      Then, we’ll add a third line to the parameter text that includes the correct spelling of Dan Aykroyd’s name, like the one below:   “Actually, the correct spelling is Aykroyd.”  When we run the process again, a new QID column appears in the results. Notice that “Dan Akroyd” and “Aykroyd” have the same QID value — Rosette has correctly identified them as the same entity.      QID values are drawn from Wikidata, so if an entity has a Wikidata entry, Rosette should be able to link and resolve it.      QIDs are very useful for machine reading-purposes, but for humans they can be difficult to keep track of. Let’s turn on the Include Entity Name parameter, which will allow us to see the entity names in addition to their QIDs.       Try it Yourself Now that you’ve got the Rosette Text Toolkit up and running with RapidMiner Studio, you are well equipped to handle a host of text analytics tasks. Incorporate results like the ones above into your pre-existing data processes, and check out our other operators, including Categorization, Sentiment Analysis, Morphological Analysis, Tokenization, Sentence Tagging, Name Translation, and Name Matching. While you’re at it, keep us posted! We love to hear what our users are working on, and would be thrilled to share your Rosette for RapidMiner story on our blog and here in the RapidMiner Community.",FALSE

In the following I will shortly explain the basics of what Word2Vec does and afterwards how you can use this in your RapidMiner text mining processes.   What is Word2Vec One of the key problems of text mining is that distances between words are hard to define. One could also say: """"It’s hard to do math with words by itself in anyway."""" For example, there are words like beautiful and gorgeous, which have similar meanings but are spelled very differently. How should an algorithm know that """"beautiful"""" and """"gorgeous"""" have the same meaning? Or do they have similar connotations but have different meanings?   Word2Vec is a word vector algorithm which attempts to tackle this problem. As the title implies, this operator takes a word and turns it into a vector. So how is so special about Word2Vec? The cool part is that this new Word2Vec vector can be associated with the “meaning” of a word. For example:   1. Let's take a sentence from raw text:             RapidMiner has a new extension called Word2Vec   2. Now let's 'window' our sentence and always leave out the word in the middle:                   RapidMiner has  ___  new extension                 has a ___extension called                 new extension ___ Word2Vec   3. Word2Vec defines a probability P for the for the missing word, depending on the surrounding words. In fact, Word2Vec assigns a vector for every word. The whole trick of Word2Vec is that it optimises all vector entries to maximize the probability for the correct gap words and minimizes it for others. This way it assigns a vector to every word.   Sample Process with Word2Vec There are various ways to use Word2Vec as a useful addition to your data science processes. In this sample process we will create a custom stemming dictionary from TripAdvisor review data (available here). All depicted processes are attached to this post.   Our analysis is split in three parts. The first part reads in the data and transforms it into a collection of documents. Each document is already tokenized.  The second process will then create a Word2Vec model on it, and the final third model is generating a stemming dictionary.   Step 1: Read and Tokenize The data is provided in one flat file for each hotel with the following structure:   <Overall Rating>4<Avg. Price>$302<URL>http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100504-r22932337-Hotel_Monaco_Seattle_a_Kimpton_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html<Author>selizabethm<Content>Wonderful time- even with the snow! What a great experience! From the goldfish in the room (which my daughter loved) to the fact that the valet parking staff who put on my chains on for me it was fabulous. The staff was attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Oh, and about the parking: the charge is about what you would pay at any garage or lot- and I bet they wouldn't help you out in the snow!<Date>Dec 23, 2008<No. Reader>-1<No. Helpful>-1<Overall>5<Value>4<Rooms>5<Location>5<Cleanliness>5<Check in / front desk>5<Service>5<Business service>-1   We read all files in with a Loop Files + Read Document combination, and then loop over all documents to extract only the content with a Cut Document operator. In the Cut Document we quickly transform all tokens to lower case and tokenize our document. After flattening the collection to one straight collection of documents, we store it in our repository for later use.   Read In Process   Step 2: Train the Model Training a Word2Vec model is straightforward: get the data, apply Word2Vec, and store the result. The layer size, which defines the length of one vector, is set to a moderate 100 and the window size is set to 7. The iterations parameter is set to a high 50, which should ensure convergence.Training Process Step 3: Building the Stemming Dictionary   Building the final dictionary needs a tiny bit of postprocesseing. The new operator Extract Vocabulary is able to extract vectors for all or parts of the used corpus. Using Cross distance it is possible to get the distance between to word vectors measured in cosine similiary. In the postpocessing we first need to remove duplicates of words which were created in the cross distance.   Afterwards there is a different type of duplicates. These are the ones were the first word in the first example equals the second word in the second example and vice versa. Word1                                  Word2 Gorgeous                            Beautiful Beautiful                              Gorgeous  The final processing process with a postprocessing which creates a stemming dictionary Finally we apply a threshold on the similarity to produce a well-pruned list. This is controlled with a macro and can thus also be used from the outside. The only thing we need to make sure is that a word is not a synonym more than once. We can do this by removing some additional duplicates.   Let's have a look at the results!Examples for found synonymsIf you examine the results you can see some obvious similarities like wall and walls, and some more clever synonyms like people and guests, anywhere and somewhere.   Where it gets interesting are that sometimes words with opposite meanings are considered synonyms (best-worst, warm-cool etc). This is due to the way Word2Vec works in that these words can be put into the same gaps – hence considered similar to each other. Depending on the task you do this can be useful (e.g. topic recognition) or detrimental (e.g. sentiment analysis). For the latter you need to manually walk through the result list and prune more.   As a last step we can use an Aggregate operator in combination with a Generate Attributes operator to generate regular expressions.  For example:    amazing:awesome   american:european   amsterdam:berlin   and:very|with   another:later   anywhere:somewhere   appointed:maintained   area:areas   arrived:checked|arrival   asked:requested|ask    The format can be used on any document you have. The operator for this is called “Stem Tokens using Example Set” and is part of Operator Toolbox extension.   Where can I learn more?  The original paper This lecture by Stanford University",FALSE

I read that Stacking requires that the base learner and the stacking model learner have similar labels so I cannot use that.  Is there any other way to do this? Thank You for taking the time to help.",FALSE

I try training a linear regression model on a dataset (we can consider the Polynomial dataset for instance, with 200 examples), using cross-validation (with shuffled sampling): on the training side, there is simply a linear regression with the default parameters; on the testing side, an apply model and a performance evaluation. What I'm doing is trying to change the number of folds the model gets trained on. Here are some values I observed with that dataset:5-fold CV: correlation = 0.894 +/- 0.026 (micro average: 0.892)10-fold CV: correlation = 0.902 +/- 0.038 (micro average: 0.891)20-fold CV: correlation = 0.909 +/- 0.080 (micro average: 0.894)50-fold CV: correlation = 0.899 +/- 0.174 (micro average: 0.894)100-fold CV: correlation = 0.960 +/- 0.197 (micro average: 0.894)150-fold CV: correlation = 0.300 +/- 0.460 (micro average: 0.894)200-fold CV: correlation = 0.000 +/- 0.000 (micro average: 0.894)So, clearly at first increasing the number of folds means more data is getting seen to train the model, so it makes sense that the performance may increase slightly until 100-fold. What confuses me more is what happens after: I agree it doesn't quite make sense to do 150 folds, because I'm not sure how one divides 200 into 150 folds - I assume there may be some repetition in the training sets? Still, I'd expect a warning telling me it's potentially problematic, but I don't quite get why the correlation value collapses. And finally, at 200-fold, which is equivalent to a leave-one-out CV, the correlation value is at 0.So does it mean the """"best"""" value for the number of folds in that case is half the number of examples in the dataset? If so, why is that? Or should I only rely on the micro-averages which are pretty stable?",FALSE

If I miss the target by more than 15% however there is a fine imposed which is dependent on the direction in which I miss my target. So if I underestimate values by 15% or more, I have to pay a €500 fine, if I overestimate values by 15% or more, I have to pay a €1000 fine. Currently my model correctly predcits 3/4ths of the database. However I this leaves me with a significant cost, which is equally distributed on both predicting too high and predicting too low. I would like to modify the model to take this price differential into account to reduce the cost of the misses. This means I would rather undershoot than overshoot my target since that is cheaper.Currently I have two columns generated, which define if I overshoot (true,False) or undershoot (true, false) the target by 15% or more. Is there any way I could do this? I know this will probably reduce the accuracy of the model, but getting total cost down is important from a business point of view.kind regards,Hauke",FALSE

In the forum I couldn't find anything that would solve my problem, sorry if I missed something there.     I want to build a model which classifies the correct party from a given speech. I have a large corpus with around 20 000 speeches, which are labeled with one of the six parties. Therefore I made a little pre processing (transform cases, filter stopwords, stem...) and built a model via split validation (70% train, 30% test). I tried a few classification methods like Naive Bayes, libSVM and multinomial Naive Bayes (weka extension).      Only with the normal Naive Bayes i got a result with around 40% accuracy. For libSVM and multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) almost all speeches are predicted to one party.      But in the literature the latter two models are recommended for text classification, that's why I'm here to ask, if someone could give me an advice how to implement a better libSVM/MNB.

"David_A","December 3, 2020 10:54AM","[New Extension] Kafka Connector","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/58217/new-extension-kafka-connector","SummaryThis extension contains operators to work with the Apache Kafka message broker.It adds two operators to interact with a specific Kafka topic:Read messages from a topic, either old messages in a batch, or collect new published messagesWrite data from an example set as new messages into a topic on a Kafka clusterBoth operators collect the data batch wise and work best in combination with either background execution or a deployment on AI Hub or with a Real-Time-Scoring agent.To ease the access to existing Kafka servers, the extension supports a new Connection Object to store and share connection details.Use Case examplesRead past messages from a topicWith the """"Read Kafka Topic"""" operator and the polling strategy set to earliest, you can retrieve past messages stored under a given topic. This can be used to analyze and potentially build a model on historic data.Read new messages from a topicWith the """"Read Kafka Topic"""" operator and the polling strategy set to latest, you can retrieve newly published messages from a topic. There is an option to either wait until a specified number of messages are retrieved or to wait a fixed amount of time and return all messages published during that time. This can be used in a deployment to apply a learned model on fresh data or check for specific events. Write messages to a topic With the """"Write Kafka Topic"""" operator, any example set data can be converted into a message and be pushed to a given topic. Each example or row is converted to a message (either as simple string or in a JSON format) and send to the message broker. There is an option to either send all messages in a bulk or in a specified time interval.  This can be used for example to publish scored or transformed data back into a Kafka stream.Train on historic data and score on new messages With a combination of read and write it's easy to build a model that is trained on past messages that are stored on the cluster and then periodically retrieve new messages and apply the model on them. The scored data can then even be published again into a new topic. DisclaimerThis is an early version of the extension, so be aware of missing features. Feedback is much appreciated.The extension itself only functions as a message consumer or producer. There is no shipped Kafka cluster with the extension, but it's also not needed for simple reading or writing operations.",FALSE

I have posted this before under a different caption but have not received any response. I am trying to build a model which must take in all inputs as arrays. (Each cell would consist of arrays of the same size). The numerical inputs have to be arrays and the categorical ones also have to be arrays. The reason is that the predicted output is provided as a """"group"""" but there are several members in each group which have separate decision variables. . Each member contributes to the group output in different ways depending on its decision variables. Imagine for example that I have 1000 football matches as sample data and would like to predict the number of goals that will be scored by a team from that dataset. I know that the number of goals is based on team work and each player contributes to the goal. So I get the decision variable for each team player such as (age, skill level, experience, role  etc), but my predicted output (number of goals) is a 'group value' so I cant assign an output for each player rather I can only assign an output for each team, but I need to be able to individually provide the input variables for each and all players  (array) of that team in each cell.  How is this kind of problem solved in rapidminer?",FALSE

I've followed the LSTM's tutorial process 'Regression of airline passengers' and implemented it to my data for prediction and faced some problems.1. Operator 'TimeSeries to Tensor' does not allow 'Missing values'.- The point of my project is to predict future settlement. I've used simple Neural Network for my past project before and predicting settlement was possible by adding future 'Date' with corresponding settlement data as 'Missing data' to Neural Network as test data. So, I tried the same method to LSTM and failed. I've only succeeded in supervised learning with LSTM...-> Is it possible to implement 'Missing values' to Tensor operators? ...and will it help with unsupervised learning? 2. Is there other ways to predict future values with unsupervised LSTM?- Sounds like a silly question but I just can't the way to do it. the tutorial process 'Regression of airline passengers' showed only supervised learning results, not future prediction.I'm very new to data science and don't have much knowledge on coding, so if LSTM prediction via Rapidminer is out of my capacity, I'll have to find other ways for my project. I have attached excel files and images of it for explaining.Help would be great, Thanks!",FALSE

Each member contributes to the group output in different ways depending on its decision variables. Imagine for example that I have 1000 football matches and would like to predict the number of goals that will be scored by a team from that dataset. I know that the number of goals is based on team work and each player contributes to the goal. So I get the decision variable for each team player such as (age, skill level, experience, role  etc), but my predicted output (number of goals) is a 'group value' so I cant assign an output for each player rather I can only assign an output for each team, but I need to be able to individually provide the input variables for each and all players  (array) of that team in each cell.  How is this kind of problem solved in rapidminer?",FALSE

"MartinLiebig","December 2, 2020 8:01AM","Holiday Release of Operator Toolbox!","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/58210/holiday-release-of-operator-toolbox","Hello everybody! I have the great honor to announce the next release of our operator toolbox extension. With this extension we add some useful new functionality as well as build on our existing capabilities. But without further delay, lets talk about the new things!    Detect Outliers (Univariate)Often you want to figure out if a value is strange. RapidMiner already offers a lot of complex algorithms like LOF, CBLOF, rPCA and all the good stuff in the anomaly detection extension. .   The easy methods like a traditional z-score were not yet embedded into single operator – So that’s what we did here! One operator to check for odd things:    The out port contains a table with all the information you need.     We added a column containing an overall outlier score, which aggregates the scores of the individual columns. Usually this is the average of the columns, but you can also get the max or the product.  The vis ports uses an old friend of yours – The explain predictions object! You know it from the Explain Predictions operator or from AutoModel. In this case we use it not to visualize the influence factors for the score, but to visualize the outlierness of every single value:  As expected an age of 0.9 is an outlier.  Lastly the operator also gives you a preprocessing model which allows you to apply the algorithms fitted on this data set on a different data set using the Apply Model operator.  This operator currently supports three methods to calculate the score:  - z-Score: How many standard deviations are you away from the mean? I.e. score = (x-mean)/std_dev  - Quartiles: How many interquartile-ranges are you away from the median? I.e. score (x-median)/iqr where IQR is the delta of the 25th and the 75th percentile. This is very similar to the Tukey Test operator.  - Histogram: Use a Histgoram of the data. If the value is a value of a unfrequent bin, than this is an outlier. This is similar to the HBOS operator  Scan your Repository and your Processes  To manage your repository from processes we added the ability to scan it! The List Repository Object can be pointed to any directory and gives you all the objects in the folder structure.     This allows you to also execute every process in a folder by combining this with Loop Values and Execute process. There are multiple other use cases if you combine this with loops.  The Scan Processes operator allows you to go deeper into processes. It gives you a list of all operators used in the processes of a folder.    One use case for this is to search for deprecated operators or operators you do not want to use anymore. Another use case is of course to analyze your own processes using machine learning!  Store (Tagged)  Have you ever wondered  who created an object? Or when? Or with what commit-id on a RM Project? The Store (Tagged) operator gives you exactly this option! If you store an object with this Store (Tagged) you will get all of this information as an annotation to the object.    This works for every object, not just for tables.   Read and Write SFTP support private keys now  The Read and Write SFTP operators did support proxies and username/password authentication from the last toolbox version. We went a step further and add the ability to use keys for this.",FALSE

"StupidForumName_12","November 24, 2020 10:47AM","The ‘Spreadsheet Table Extraction’ - Extension Release","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/38864/the-spreadsheet-table-extraction-extension-release","By: Edwin Yaqub, PhD In this article, you will be introduced to the ‘Spreadsheet Table Extraction’ - a new extension developed by RapidMiner Research. This article also provides a walk-through on how this extension may fit into your analysis process chain.   Motivation:   Many organizations are storing data in Google spreadsheets because they offer several advantages over offline spreadsheet solutions. To name a few: high availability of data and ease of collaboration based on sharing rights. Its integration with Google Drive and Google Docs allows to fetch spreadsheets (also having a different formats) from these sources.   The extension provides a ‘Read Google Spreadsheet’ operator, which extracts data from a Google Spreadsheet document and converts it to RapidMiner ExampleSet. Hence, it extends the reach of your data mining processes to live documents, which may be regularly updated e.g., if you are collecting feedback, sales or any other data from multiple customers or stakeholders. Thus, this operator enables you to stay up-to-date with newly arriving data, continuously assess your analytics models and adjust business decisions if necessary.   Let’s take an example to bring these concepts in a unified scenario by virtue of which you can learn the enrichment and integration capabilities of RapidMiner. This not only includes data but also third party services.   Pre-Requisites:   Please install the following extensions through the RapidMiner Marketplace to ensure you can reproduce the steps presented next: Web Mining Extension Text Processing Extension Spreadsheet Table Extraction Extension   A Unified Example Scenario for Text Analytics (Extract, Enrich, Process, Interpret):   We consider the simple case of a book (or another product for that matter) review for demonstration purpose only. A good debut of a book may start with large purchases due to initial hype, but for the book stores, publishers or resellers, user feedback is essential to determine the consumer/market sentiment over time. Insights based on sentiment analysis can lead to e.g., better inventory management or creating improved selling propositions.   Extract: We take a subset of customer reviews for the book ‘The Martian’ as made on amazon.com. After cleaning the data, the review text (excluding ranking information) is made available as a Google spreadsheet at [1]. The ‘Read Google Spreadsheet’ operator reads this sheet in RapidMiner as shown  in Fig.  1. Simply provide it the url of spreadsheet, the sheet name and a client secret file.          Obtaining the client secret file:   As Google spreadsheets are managed by Google API servers, you need to turn-on the Google Sheets API for your Google account and get a client secret (JSON) file, which contains your authentication credentials. To obtain it, you can follow the following steps: Visit Google Developers Console at 'https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sheets.googleapis.com'. Create or select a project from the list box. This also enables API for your project. Go to 'credentials'. Now you land on the 'Add credentials to your project' page. Click Cancel. Now select 'OAuth consent screen' tab. Provide email and a product name and click Save. Now you are at the 'Credentials' tab. Click the 'Create credentials' list box button and select 'OAuth client ID'. From the list of options, select 'Other', provide a name and click Create. Now you see your 'OAuth 2.0 client ID' under the Credentials tab. Click the 'Download JSON' link. This gives you your client secret file.   Enrich: We have already extracted data from a Google spreadsheet. Now let us set two objectives towards analysing this text data: Understanding the polarity of users' sentiment towards this book through a third-party service, thereby enriching the data further. Identifying the more frequently used words that influence the polarity classes.    To analyse sentiment, one approach is to use a dictionary such as the RapidMiner Wordnet dictionary as explained here [3]. The other approach that we will use is to use a third-party service, that already provides such a classification on whole sentences. In this example, we will use IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding (NLU) API - a state of the art in natural language processing (NLP) technologies to classify examples in our dataset as positive, negative or neutral. Fig.  2 shows the RapidMiner process that achieves this. Fig.  2 RapidMiner process to read Google spreadsheet, some filtering and enrichment by Webservice invocation As seen, we filter examples with the length of review text limited to one thousand characters in length. This leaves us with 600 examples. We then stuff this text (found under attribute name ‘review’) in the payload of a webservice request that will be invoked using the ‘Enrich Data by Webservice’ operator (from the Web Mining extension). The operator makes an API call for each example of the ExampleSet provided to it. To get authenticated by the API, just create a free user account at [4] and you will receive your login credentials. Upon first invocation, the operator prompts for your username and password as shown in Fig.  3.      The main parameters of the ‘Enrich Data by Webservice’ operator are configured to satisfy the API requirements [5] as follows: request method = POST, request properties = Content-Type: application/json query type = Regular Expression attribute type = Nominal Point the url to [6]  4 shows the value for body parameter (the JSON to send as a request) and the regular expression queries we apply to extract results from the response JSON.        As seen in Fig.  4, we enquire Watson about several features: the sentiment (polarity and score) to be assessed from the document i.e. the chunk of text (value of our ‘review’ attribute). If we think how we humans share our experience about something, we often talk about an object or place or a personality in terms of our impressions. Such information can help understand the context of our customer reviews. Like some other systems [8,9] Watson can also extract entities from text as Person, a Quantity, an Organization, a Movie, a Location, a Company, a Broadcaster, a Job Title, etc. Further we can assess emotion (as a score between [0,1]) associated with the entity e.g., disgust, joy, sadness, fear or anger.   In this way, we have enriched our dataset using an external system. This demonstrates how API based systems can be harnessed rather conveniently and hooked with our RapidMiner processes to develop well integrated quasi service-driven data mining workflows – all within RapidMiner Studio!   Other advanced features can be enquired from Watson as well, but our free account is limited in terms of API calls per day, payload size (that’s why we used reviews of limited length earlier) and the number of features requested – all billable items that need careful consideration.   Process: By now we have enriched the data with a third-party sentiment classification service. This data set is made available at [2] for your reference. What remains to be identified are words that influence these class labels the most. We will use feature weights to determine this, but before that, we prepare an unbiased dataset comprising an equal number of positive and negative reviews. This gives us a reduced dataset of 304 examples, 152 for positive and negative, while ignoring the neutral ones as they are less discriminating and hence less interesting.   Next, we use the Text Processing extension to build a standard operator chain inside the ‘Process Documents from Data’ operator, as seen in Fig.  5. Use TF-IDF for word vector creation and pruning methods to see the impact on number of attributes (tokens) you get. You will notice that percentual pruning in the range [3.0, 30.0] already reduces attributes from 10633 to 223, with no negative effect on the results but noticeable difference in execution speed of the process due to processing complexity. The sub-process performs tokenization, filtering out tokens smaller or larger than certain lengths as well as stop words as these bring no value, change case, apply stem so similar origin words are considered related, and finally we apply n-Grams as 2-Grams. The latter is helpful in analysing writing styles that use adjective declinations e.g., brilliant plot, excellent book, etc. This complex processing is relatively straight forward in RapidMiner.      The complete process uses several steps and is attached with this article for your reference.    Depending on the text, tokenization can result in many attributes (despite pruning). The question is which of these features are rather important? Weights to the rescue! The weight of an attribute gives its importance in relation to the target attribute, also called label. Once we have the weights, we can associate our preference to attributes.   RapidMiner offers more than a dozen operators that can characterize attributes with weights. We assign the role of label to the polarity attribute and split the data in two sets (one containing positive and other negative examples). Then we simply apply ‘Weight by Value Average’ operator on each set to weight attributes against their class. Next, the ‘Select by Weights’ operator can filter out attributes whose weights are above a desired threshold, say 0.6. This gives us most influencing attributes (in terms of their TF-IDF occurrence frequencies). Feature weighing is explained in a community article available at [7] which also touches on feature selection in RapidMiner. Interpret: We can now interpret results of our text analytic process. Three main insights were discovered. Overall polarity score: This showed that the average positive value is higher than average negative (+0.5 vs -0.34). This sounds good for the author, publishers and resellers. The bag of influential words that are found exclusively in positive reviews are shown below:  great, enjoy, love, recommend, make, fiction, survive, read_book, book_read, mark, science_fiction        Notice the combinations like read_book and science_fiction, captured by the 2-Gram n-Gram. Similarly, the influential words associated exclusively with negative reviews are:  martian, mar, detail, technic, page, novel, plot, know, found, finish, work, write, movie, weir          A bit tricky are the overlapping words i.e. those that appear in both positive and negative reviews. These are: “good, time, author, interest”. One way to analyse these is to look at the distribution of their TF-IDF values in data, as shown for the word ‘time’ and ‘author’ in Fig.  6.          The entity analysis based on average values reveals that of the 223 reviews (quite a small dataset), 168 talked about some entities and associated a certain emotion with them as seen in the table below:        Except for the Quantity entity, Watson seems quite confident about the entities it detected (relevance > 0.8). The entity Person tops the count and the strongest emotion associated with it is sadness (value > 0.3). The concatenation of entity names (shown as the last column) gives clues in that direction.   Conclusion:   In this article, you learned about the new extension for reading Google Spreadsheets as ExampleSets in RapidMiner. Using this as a starting point, a more holistic scenario was presented. We gradually moved from data extraction to data enrichment through a third-party API. We then performed text analytics using out-of-the-box features of RapidMiner. Finally, we got a glimpse of how the amazon.com customers reviewed the book ‘The Martian’. Our limited dataset served as an educating exercise and is of course not meant to influence the book sales or market opinion in any way.   Acknowledgments:   The Spreadsheet Table Extraction extension is developed as part of “Data Search for Data Mining (DS4DM)” project (website: http://ds4dm.com) which is sponsored by the German ministry of education and research (BMBF).     References: [1] A sample Google Spreadsheet, sheet name ‘The Martian’, weblink: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vRJi3Ur3w6-9WhOa0G-vJ6GR4-RWGiBCwrQok5ILsow/edit#gid=1779829764 [2] A sample Google Spreadsheet, sheet name ‘Sentiments’, weblink: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vRJi3Ur3w6-9WhOa0G-vJ6GR4-RWGiBCwrQok5ILsow/edit#gid=1445561426 [3] RapidMiner Community article, Sentiment Analysis using Wordnet Dictionary, weblink: http://community.rapidminer.com/t5/Text-Analytics-in-RapidMiner/Sentiment-Analysis-using-Wordnet-Dictionary/ta-p/31664 [4] IBM API Accounts, weblink: https://myibm.ibm.com/dashboard/ [5] IBM NLU API reference, weblink: https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-understanding/api/v1/#sentiment [6] Endpoint Reference of IBM NLU API, weblink: https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-understanding/api/v1/analyze?version=2017-02-27 [7] RapidMiner Community article, Feature Weighting Tutorial, weblink: http://community.rapidminer.com/t5/RapidMiner-Studio-Knowledge-Base/Feature-Weighting-Tutorial/ta-p/35281 [8] Rosette extension for RapidMiner, weblink: https://marketplace.rapidminer.com/UpdateServer/faces/download.xhtml?productId=rmx_rosette_text_toolkit&platform=ANY&version=1.3.1 [9] Aylien extension for RapidMiner, weblink: https://marketplace.rapidminer.com/UpdateServer/faces/download.xhtml?productId=rmx_com.aylien.textapi.rapidminer&platform=ANY&version=0.2.0",FALSE

The documentation on it is quite sparse and even after reading many posts on this forum, I cannot find my answer. I also Here is the cost matrix for the default tutorial process for the MetaCost operator (distinguishing mines from rocks in the Sonar dataset):Class 1 is Rock; Class 2 is Mine.That image refers to the Matlab cost matrix format (which I think is here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/classification-with-unequal-misclassification-costs.html), but I still have many questions:I assume that the 2.0 and 3.0 are costs (penalties) for misclassification, since they are for wrong predictions. The Matlab instructions say that the true positive (TP) and true negative (TN) diagonal is supposed to be left at 0, but this does not make sense to me if I have benefits. Would they not be negative (opposite of costs) in that case?Here is my business scenario on an actual (but sample) dataset. A bank is trying to contact customers to offer a financial product. The cost of calling a customer is 5€. If a customer accepts the offer and purchases the product, the bank expects to receive revenues from each customer of 50€. So, the profit from a successful contact is 50€ - 5€ = 45€. The loss for calling a customer who declines is 5€. The bank has data from past customers and wants to create a model that can be used on new customers. The data is quite unbalanced; approximately 9% of customers said yes, and 91% said no. So, I would like to use MetaCost to indicate my priorities to the machine learner. How should I configure MetaCost in such a situation?Here is what I would think:That is, with """"yes"""" as the positive class:True positive: earns 45€, so cost is -45True negative: we spend nothing and gain nothing, so cost is 0False positive: we spent 5€ to call a customer but gained nothing, so cost is 5False negative: we spent nothing, but missed the opportunity of receiving 45€ profit, so cost is 45However, when I run my data with that cost matrix, my results are always unsatisfactory. I don't want to get into the details now (though I could if necessary), but when I calculated my total earnings in euro, it is always negative: I always end up losing money. Of course, this has to do with the difficulty of my data, so the learners rarely attain above 55% recall on the """"yes"""" class, but still, I wonder if I am configuring the cost matrix correctly.So, I would appreciate clear guidance on how to correctly configure the cost matrix.Regards,Chitu",FALSE

For example, if my label is binary yes and no, with yes comprising 9% of the dataset and no comprising 91%, then I would expect the accuracy of a model to be at least 91%.

For example, if there were three classes A, B and C distributed 30%, 40% and 30%, then the prevalence of the largest class (B) would be 40%.My request is that the Performance (Classification) and Performance (Binominal Classification) operators would add this as an option for criteria that they output.

In the main page of my web app, I have a bar graph of count of tweets by user name. These user names are just display names and I have a data set where the user names are associated to the user screen names (unique twitter handles). To access a twitter profile, the URL is twitter.com/*userscreenname* - it will bring you directly to the user's twitter page.In the main screen of the web app, a user can click on the user name to see a more detailed report of their tweets. This click on one of the user names in the bar graph then triggers three interactions: 1. store the user name as a macro, userName, 2. run a process that filters the twitter data to just that user name and 3. navigate to a new view in the web app where the more detailed visualizations of tweets by that user are displayed. On this more detailed display, I added an """"external resource"""" component, configured as below:Embedding the page as an image returns nothing and the """"show link"""" check box gives me the below, which is all I'm looking for. I chose not to use IFRAME because I do not need a preview of the user's pageThe click on the user name stores it as a macro on the main screen, but as I said above, it is just the display name, not the user screen name, which is the unique identifier to tack onto the end of the twitter url, thus I added a macro to my process that recalculates the tweet to store the filtered user's screen name as macro, userScreenName. The macro is initialized to """"null"""" in the RM process via the Context panel.When I click on the twitter link, it leads me to a link that is just *twitter.com/?=*, which then reloads to *twitter.com/home?=*So - there are two issues here: 1. URL template link adds additional characters that are not in the original text entered in the URL template and 2. the process that in theory should store the userScreenName macro (process filters to one individual user and then stores their unique screen name as macro userScreenName), does not pull through the stored value as the macro since nothing gets pulled through on the tail end of the link.Any help with the above two issues would be appreciated!

(Note: new compatibility level      introduced to ensure we don’t break existing behavior)It is now possible to      expose processes containing Execute Python operators as webservices on      Server!Macros are now handled      consistently in inline scripts and filesExecution robustness has been improved on Linux and MacWe have also published a new version of our python-rapidminer Python library on GitHub, which allows you to access the RapidMiner repository and execute processes right from your Python code.Enjoy! And as always, we welcome any and all feedback",FALSE

"christos_karras","October 23, 2020 2:28PM","Feature Request: In feature selection operators, allow specifying features to always include","https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/58035/feature-request-in-feature-selection-operators-allow-specifying-features-to-always-include","It would be useful for the feature selection operators (Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Optimize Selection, Optimize Selection (Evolutionary), etc) to have the ability to provide a starting set of features that we always want to include. This would be useful when we already have a working model with a basic set of features, but want to consider the addition of additional features that might be expensive to obtain (for example due to implementation complexity, high CPU/memory usage, etc)In this situation, we don't want to evaluate the existing set of features: they shouldn't be considered for addition/removal in different iterations of the feature selection operator, they should just always be there. What we want to know is, from the set of additional features, are there any features that bring a significant improvement to the model. We also want to avoid an outcome where the feature selection process chooses an expensive feature instead of one of our basic features. For example, we might be able to simply and efficiently calculate the mean value over a time window, but require a more complex implementation and higher CPU/RAM usage to get the median or 95th percentile (for example, we can query the mean directly from the source system, but need to query high resolution raw data to compute the median or 95th percentile). Without the ability to enforce a fixed set of features, the feature selection process might tell us that having the 95th percentile is more useful than having the mean, but might not tell us what kind of improvement we got by selecting the 95th percentile (was it a 0.01% improvement in accuracy, or 10%?). If instead we would enforce always including the mean in the feature sets tested by the feature selection operators, then we would expect that the 95th percentile would be picked only if it's significantly better than the mean which is always there.To overcome the lack of this feature, I implemented a hack where we hide our """"Fixed Features"""" from the feature selection operators, but add them back when training a model in the feature selection's inner process. So at each iteration, we train the model based on our Fixed Features plus the subset of the remaining features that the feature selection operator chose for this iteration. I'm sharing an example of this process, but it is meant only to illustrate the feature request, not as a real solution. It would be much easier and maintainable if the feature selection operators had the ability to select a set of fixed features. I would expect to have the flexibility to provide this set with two methods:* Using the usual feature specification options (regex, list of features, invert selection, etc)* Using an input ExampleSet that contains the list of features we want to use as """"fixed features"""". This ExampleSet would have a structure similar to what we get using the """"Weights to Data"""" operator  <?xml version=""""1.0"""" encoding=""""UTF-8""""?><process version=""""9.6.000"""">
